       " ' It should be noted that fashion is finally wising up to the fact that sexy comes in all shapes, skin tones and sizes',\n",
       " ' About time! Models Precious Lee, Alva Claire, Paloma Elsesser and Yumi Nu were among the most in-demand models for spring, bringing some much-needed body diversity to the runways',\n",
       " ' By Alice Cary A sense of loosening up permeated the collections, even when sex (or size) wasn’t on the brain',\n",
       " ' Across the board, colour comes in juicy shots – unless it’s wiped completely, in favour of head-to-toe white',\n",
       " ' Trains and capes, ripe for making an entrance (or, more accurately, an exit) proliferate with an urgency not seen since the mullet hems of the 2010s',\n",
       " ' And say hello to the biker jacket, that once ubiquitous model-off-duty staple that suddenly feels right again',\n",
       " ' And you would be partly right: spring/summer 2022 was a chaotic, creative mix of idiosyncratic takes on what the post-pandemic world wants right now',\n",
       " ' Nowhere was this frenetic energy more evident than at Louis Vuitton, where Nicolas Ghesquière imagined “the figure of a vampire who travels through the ages, adapting to dress codes of the era',\n",
       " '” Think 18th-century pannier dresses with their hems chopped to reveal red satin superhero-style boots; cape-tuxedo hybrids paired with indigo jeans; gold-braid embellished waistcoats with short cargo skirts and floor-sweeping Morticia Addams capes',\n",

       " ' Here, the 10 biggest spring/summer 2022 fashion trends you need to know about',\n",
       " ' Just when you thought the hemlines couldn’t go higher, well, along came Miuccia Prada with a Miu Miu show that made you want to take a pair of dressmaking shears to every skirt you own',\n",
       " ' Worn low on the hips and cut to a strip that just about covers the chuddies (that’s underpants, for all you international readers), Miu Miu’s minis are on the very racy side',\n",
       " '” How many years since you saw a really good biker jacket in the wild? Buckle up, lads: she’s back',\n",
       " ' At Acne Studios, Supriya Lele and Miu Miu, the biker was in a decidedly ’90s mood, taking the form of a slim-fit, lapel-free, motorcycle style with a single strap at the throat and a distressed finish',\n",
       " ' At Balenciaga and Prada, it came with more of an oversized fit, with multiple zips',\n",
       " ' And at Alexander McQueen, Simone Rocha, and Richard Quinn, things got a little funky: leather was mixed with denim, the sharp lapels came with feminine puff shoulders, or else the whole thing was smothered in studs',\n",
       " ' Take Valentino, where chocolate brown, raspberry and cerulean blue mingled to delicious effect',\n",
       " ' And if it feels too complicated to play Rothko with your wardrobe? Just take it head-to-toe, inspired by Emilia Wickstead and Christian Siriano',\n",
       " ' Imagine the swish as Gucci’s red caped mini dress wafts behind you, Gaga style',\n",
       " ' Picture the reactions as your Maximilian spikes send champagne flutes flying',\n",
       " ' Think of the hours of enjoyment you’ll get from your pink Prada satin tail creating maximum drama in your wake',\n",
       " ' A trend for those fluent in fringing and self-assured in stripes = fringed stripes',\n",
       " ' Our favourites: JW Anderson’s mini dresses, Louis Vuitton’s going-out tops (paired with deep-blue denim) and Gucci’s feathered coat',\n",
       " ' If the fringe feels too frou-frou, just order classic marinière strokes, seen at Balmain; 1970s diagonals, wafting down the catwalk at Fendi; or libertine lines, taken every which way at Marni',\n",
       " ' Here’s one for the minimalists: a shock of Colgate white, worn head-to-toe, felt particularly fresh for spring/summer 2022',\n",
       " ' So too Alaïa, where Pieter Mulier contrasted sinuous fits with crisp white cottons',\n",
       " ' At Hermès and Valentino, updates on the white trouser suit were particularly enticing',\n",
       " ' And at Chloé, head-to-toe white even felt bohemian; a warm, cosy antidote to more clinical takes on the trend',\n",
       " ' Super sheer, super tight, and super short',\n",
       " ' If you’re interested in the key dress shape for spring, then just know that fashion’s got a taste for flesh',\n",
       " ' A crop of young designers is carrying the torch for this outré take on “the new sexy”, led by LVMH Prize-winning designer Nensi Dojaka as well as Supriya Lele in London, and Ludovic de Saint Sernin and Coperni in Paris',\n",
       " ' The key to unleashing your nipples? Invest in a comfortable pair of cotton pants – and take a deep breath',\n",
       " ' It almost feels like a cop-out to lump together so many individual impulses for after-dark glamour, but how else to sum up the industry’s deep desire to go out on the town? Sequins, chainmail, sparkling mesh, crystals and heavily-embellished styles abounded on the catwalks as sweet release from challenging lockdowns beckoned',\n",
       " ' Being over-dressed is incontrovertibly a thing of the past',\n",
       " ' Crop tops and butterflies, Grecian draping and low-rise pants, body chains and skinny, completely useless scarves – it will be tough to resist the siren song of the 2000s come spring',\n",
       " ' Blumarine, now the epitome of Y2K style, went all in at its Milan show, promoting “military fairies…sexy butterfly girls…low-waisted mermaids” as the new-season icons to emulate, as stylist Lotta Volkova put it',\n",
       " ' Even Etro went low-rise and stomach-bared, while cargo pants popped up at, among others, Tom Ford and Zimmermann',\n",
       " ' You can bet Dua Lipa and the rest of the TikTok generation is going to fall for every single look at KNWLS, Roberto Cavalli and Dolce & Gabbana',\n",
       " ' For as Tom Ford, quoting Diana Vreeland, succinctly put it in his show notes: “I know it’s a lot but is it enough?” Want the confidence-inducing cut that’s guaranteed by good tailoring, as well as the feminine ease of a pleated skirt? You’re in luck',\n",
       " ' Spring’s fashion solution to this particularly pandemic-induced conundrum is a boy-meets-girl combination of structured blazer and fluid dress',\n",
       " ' At Altuzarra, it looked particularly straightforward, in tonal shades of berry; at Louis Vuitton, things were a little more theatrical but the premise was similarly comfort-driven',\n",
       " ' Of course, you could forgo the dress, as suggested by Saint Laurent, where Anthony Vaccarello paired precision tailoring with sheer tights or body stockings',\n",
       " ' But why miss out on the chance to play? Make like Naomi Campbell at Alexander McQueen, with masses of tulle and a cropped smoking jacket, and you can have the best of both worlds',\n",
