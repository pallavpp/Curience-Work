,7 Fashion Experts Share Their Predictions for the Top Fashion Trends of 2022,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/best-2022-fashion-trends,,,,,,"Whether by way of magic, research, or just sheer intuition, fashion experts have mastered the art of trend forecasting. Even at the height of a global pandemic, when we essentially ignored half of what was hanging in our closets, stylists speculated that things like elevated loungewear and sensible staples would dominate 2021 — and they weren't wrong. Now, with a new year on the horizon, and a world working towards a sense of normalcy (especially in terms of fashion), stylists have begun prophesizing the top trends of 2022. Needless to say, we're all ears. To find out which pieces in our wardrobes today will feel most relevant in the months to come, we reached out to celebrity stylists and brand founders for their insider intel. Ahead, you'll find that their visions of what we'll all be wearing in 2022 consist of some of the same types of clothing items that made us feel comfortable and comforted over the last two years but styled in a way that feels fresh. Read on for expert tips on how to embrace it all. RELATED: You Can Easily Recreate This Spring '22 Trend Using the Clothes in Your Closet Has Worked With: Shawn Mendes, Kane Brown, Richard Ellis, Jack Dylan Grazer Follow Her: @tiffbrisenostylist Her Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: Rhinestone headpieces ""We are starting to see this trend hit the red carpets this fall, but I see this being a look that will stay with us right until 'hot girl summer' returns next year. I'm a huge fan of thinking outside of the box with fabric or embellishments — I call this the 'the Cleopatra tiara.' You can use this trend more subtly with one or two strands in the hair, or complete coverage. Keep in mind that a great look is always about balance, and if you are trying this trend, the rhinestones will serve as your statement piece so build the rest of the look around that. Perhaps more of a casual streetwear approach to neutralize the bling up top."" Has Worked With: Meryl Streep, Lupita Nyong'o, Common, Sigourney Weaver, Lucy Hale, and Shailene Woodley Follow Her: @micaela Her Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: Bodysuits ""Bodysuits are having a major moment right now and are a perfect base layer to dress up or down while still staying comfy. For something a little more elevated, pair a bodysuit (like this one from Bandier x New Balance) with a classic trench and lug sole Chelsea boot, or a platform loafer like Koio's Bari — perfect for dinner or drinks with friends."" Her Job: Founder & Chief Brand Officer of Bandier Follow Her: Jennifer Bandier on LinkedIn Her Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: Tennis-inspired clothing and a spotlight on sneakers ""It seems like everyone I know picked up tennis in the past year if they weren't playing already. Look for a lot more tennis-inspired fashion on and off the court: cropped and oversized polos, sweaters haphazardly tied around your shoulders, pleated skirts. A modern take on country club style. Brands like Danzy, who we carry at Bandier, continue to push those limits with embroidered crests and logos. You'll see more from All Access, too."" RELATED: This Random Schoolcore Trend Has Produced Instagram's Most Popular Outfit ""This past year has been all about comfort, and the range of sneaker styles is more relevant than ever. There are high-tech, fluorescent ones (Nike, Hoka), classics (Sambas, AF1s, New Balance), and more fashion-forward sneakers from Axel Arigato. We've all pretty much embraced a Dad sneaker at this point, and that's not changing, but I think how we wear them — whether it's truly for a workout or paired with cut-offs or a silk slip dress — is what will continue to keep them fresh."" Has Worked With: Christie Brinkley, Ebonee Davis Adrien Brody, Nina Agdal, Karolina Kurkova Follow Her: @jamiefrankel Her Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: All things monochromatic ""I think jumpsuits and monochromatic dressing will be a big part of 2022. As we ease back in, I think people want to feel put together with minimal effort. We have enough to think about these days!"" RELATED: Megan Fox Wore a Subtly Sexy Monochromatic Matching Set His Job: Stylist at OAK + FORT Has Worked With: Aliza Vellani, Emilija Baranac, Kurt Yaeger Follow Him: @p_sumeracruz His Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: Bold colors and textures ""We are excited to see the infusion of more vibrant color, print, and texture next year — staying true to our minimal and timeless roots while exploring expressive pieces. We are forward-looking through a positive lens in everything as the world continues to evolve towards a post-pandemic state of being."" Her Job: CEO + Co-Founder of AYR Follow Her: Maggie Winter on LinkedIn Her Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: Seasonless wardrobes ""Our team has really been feeling a major closet cleanout — sort of a wardrobe reset. There's stuff that doesn't make sense anymore, and we find ourselves wanting to start fresh. We want less stuff, and we want to invest in pieces that make us feel good. We're donating the clothes in our closet that feel too specific, too fussy, too extra, and we're doing the same with our own line. If you never reach for it in the morning, if it's gathering dust on the hanger, it's probably ok to set it free. Invest in The Best version of each item — a perfect oversized button-down in crisp poplin or broken-in Oxford, a perfect trouser, a perfect silk layering top."" RELATED: What Is a Capsule Wardrobe? 10 Tips to Help You De-Clutter Your Closet Has Worked With: Keke Palmer, Lil Mama, Peyton List, Dylan Sprouse, B2K Follow Him: @mickeyboooom His Forecast For 2022 Fashion Trends: Genderless wardrobes and nostalgic prints ""We will see Androgynous fashion trends in 2022, specifically women wearing men's suits and men wearing kilts/pleated skirts. Women can achieve this look with a white shirt and boots. Think Marlene Dietrich. I believe what is considered masculine and feminine in terms of fashion will continue to evolve, continuously merging and accommodating however a person chooses to express themselves at that moment."" ""Cartoons and comics will be so trendy in 2022. Think Moschino by Jeremy Scott. People are eager to embrace the fun times again. There's nothing like the nostalgia of childhood, cartoons, crayons, and comics. This is a trend that works for some, but can overpower depending on the occasion. Oversized hair bows will also make a huge comeback.""","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us 7 Fashion Experts Share Their Predictions for the Top Trends of 2022 Tiffany Briseno Micaela Erlanger Jennifer Bandier Jamie Frankel Peter Sumeracruz Maggie Winter Mickey Freeman Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

Fashion Trends,Ready to skip winter? These are all the summer 2022 trends to look forward to according to Copenhagen Fashion Week,Your first look at SS22.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/copenhagen-fashion-week-trends-ss22,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61389b36236c41e8314899c6/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/sqjpg.jpg,,,," By Charlie Teather If you thought September was the only month to host spring/summer showcases, and that New York, London, Milan and Paris were the four cities to dictate the season's biggest trends, you may just be neglecting what is fast-becoming one of the most highly-regarded fashion weeks in the industry. Having just closed its SS22 showcase, it fell to Scandi fashion stalwart Copenhagen to be the first to showcase its vision for next season. And if this last week of catwalks is anything to go by, we're already Googling ways to fast-forward the next few months, skip winter and wake up to these mega trends. And while we may all be familiar with the likes of Dior, Saint Laurent and Chanel showing in Paris, Marc Jacobs and The Row in New York, Victoria Beckham and Burberry in London, and Prada and Miu Miu in Milan, Copenhagen Fashion Week is by no means lacking in well-known and much-loved fashion brands. From Ganni and Rotate to Baum Und Pferdgarten, Remain, Saks Potts and By Malene Birger, this showcase is a serious seasonal highlight for both fashion fans, buyers and editors alike thanks to its contemporary designers who prioritise elevated wearables. It's not about the statement-making showstoppers, but rather the collections of beautiful staples with unexpected design accents that would add a high-fashion twist to just about any wardrobe. Of course, as is always the case at CPHFW, it wasn't just the runways that served up some seriously epic sartorial inspo. With a guestlist including the likes of Emili Sindlev, Jeanette Madsen, Pernille Teisbaek, Thora Valdimars, Nnenna, Hanna Stefansson, Chrystelle Eriksberger and Anna Winck, the Scandi street style set has made a name for itself as one of the most creative crowds to flock to a fashion week anywhere in the world. But what trends reigned supreme on the runway at Copenhagen for next season? For more from Glamour UK's Fashion Editor Charlie Teather, follow her on Instagram @charlieteather. Cropped tops have been gaining a lot of traction over recent months, but it seems for SS22 the bar (or, rather, the hemline) is raised even higher, with bralettes becoming an entirely viable daywear option. Wear yours with loose-fitting bottoms and an oversized open layer over the top to create a contradictory and complementary silhouette.Spotted at: (L-R) Ganni, Saks Potts & Remain While the Scandi street style set may - until this season - have been known for its loyal commitment to the neutral staple, those designers taking to the runway like to inject a little bit more colour. For next season, however, they went big, and splashed multicolour across many of their designs in an abstract manner that renders the pieces total works of art.Spotted at: (L-R) Rotate, Brøgger & Stine Goya 'Winter whites' has been a real thing over recent years, but while we're all well-versed in the art of a stark puffer or tracksuit it seems the Scandi set are eager to extend the shade's lifespan with a smorgasbord of white summer suits that would work just as well in the office as they would being covered in confetti on the steps of your registry office wedding.Spotted at: (L-R) Teatum Jones, Baum Und Pferdgarten & Holzweiler Those of us with a loyal devotion to the ultra high rise may need to look away now, or at least take a deep breath, as for SS22 things get a whole lot more low-slung. Tracksuits, suit trousers, skirts and even jeans have all been lured in, so we've got until around April to make the most of those waist-cinching pieces we've come to rely on.Spotted at: (L-R) Remain, Soulland & Rotate While some shades are entirely seasonless - think neutrals, black pale pink and navy, in particular - every now and then a super punchy in-your-face hue will appear as if from nowhere and be all over the rails in your favourite shop. For SS22 it's super sour satsuma orange, and - good news for the sartorial extroverts - it's best when worn head-to-toe.Spotted at: (L-R) Remain, Ganni & Baum Und Pferdgarten Fringing is often big news for winter months, but for spring/summer 2022 we're seeing the fringed trim - more subtle splashes of the trend - adorn all manner of pieces. From the hemlines of skirts to pockets of coats and our favourite accessories, fringing is a really great way to inject a bit of texture into your look.Spotted at: (L-R) Holzweiler, Rabens Saloner & Munthe Metallics are often popular when it comes to eveningwear (particularly those OUT out looks), but for daywear it's far less ubiquitous. As showcased by some of our favourite Copenhagen-based labels, however, it's an entirely viable prospect. Pair it with a trench coat or blazer to neutralise the look and to introduce a more casual perspective.Spotted at: (L-R) Baum Und Pferdgarten, Remain & Rabens Saloner Open woven knitwear, such as crochet, is having a real moment right now, and while SS21 has seen super bright multicoloured and printed incarnations take centre stage, SS22 sees black netting take over. Whether thrown over a bikini or worn with heels for a night out, it's a super easy way to make a summer statement.Spotted at: (L-R) Soulland, Remain & Ganni While white dresses are certainly not a groundbreaking prospect for summer, Copenhagen Fashion Week saw several takes on the classic given a more contemporary twist with cutwork embroidery and clever fabrication making way for a sexier, sheer look. Perfect for the beach holiday we're all craving right now, just be sure to apply SPF all over to make up for the subtle peeks of skin.Spotted at: (L-R) Saks Potts, Teatum Jones & Skall Studio Summer may be synonymous with colour for many of us, but sometimes the most statement looks are entirely monochromatic. SS22 sees black and white dresses elevated via geometric prints which add a certain intrigue and edge to the seemingly staple pieces.Spotted at: (L-R) By Malene Birger, Teatum Jones & Munthe SEE MORE STORIES More from GLAMOUR UK © Condé Nast Britain 2022.",Ready to skip winter?

But part of us feels pretty good knowing we were working them into our wardrobe long before most of the world caught on. That's the life of a true fashion-lover: we're innovative and aim to say ahead of the game — even when our friends simply won't accept that holes are the new polka dots or popcorn shirts are back (um, we told you so!). It's this kind of attitude that also has us looking toward spring 2022 — despite the fact that we're heading into much cooler weather. For starters, a lot of what we saw coming down the runways in New York, London, Milan, and Paris actually felt pretty seasonless. And, if we're being honest, with a few quick switches and specific styling choices, those looks be created with pieces that we already own. It couldn't be easier. RELATED: Pick a Favorite Shoulder, Because Asymmetrical Styles Are Everywhere for Spring '22 Ahead, we're rounding up some spring 2022 trends that may already be sitting in your closet, along with some tips for how to wear them right now. From PatBO to Proenza Schouler, two-toned pieces popped up throughout fashion month, but the colorblocked look is easy enough to create with your own clothes. Aim to combine multiple vibrant pieces in a single look, pairing a bright-colored top with equally bold bottoms or adding electric accessories to a neon dress. Read more about spring 2022's colorblocking trend. RELATED: Proof That a Bright Pair of Boots Can Make Your Old Fall Clothes Feel Brand New At first, we admittedly rolled our eyes at ovary cutouts and hole punched clothing. But as we checked out designs from David Koma and Saint Laurent, we realized those styles were essentially on the tame side. Should you already own pieces that incorporate details like sexy slices and missing limbs, break them out now. This trend is most definitely sticking around — and getting even more extreme. Read more about spring 2022's cutout trend. With the return of Y2K fashion, we're back to teeny tiny everything. We're not just talking about crop tops and bralettes, either — two trends that have been considered staples for a while now. Mini skirts seem to be getting even more mini, and if you haven't yet re-embraced the shrug, looks that we spotted at Brandon Maxwell and Sandy Liang seem to suggest you should start. RELATED: Rihanna Wore So Many Shrugs Back in 2005 Platforms may be having a moment, but if break-your-ankle styles aren't quite your thing, you may want to go the opposite route with a micro heel, aka a footwear trend we've been tracking since early 2021. It's possible that these in-between (and sometimes controversial) babies are already sitting in the back of your closet, as they come in and out of rotation every few years. Read more about spring 2022's kitten heel trend. Remember when naked dresses were all the rage around 2016? Well they're back, only this time, there's a slightly romantic twist. Billowing sheer gowns were spotted in collections from Christian Siriano, LaQuan Smith, and more. However, if a red carpet-worthy, see-through something feels a bit extreme, your favorite organza top or jacket is a great way to ease into the look.

,10 trends that define the Spring 2022 season,,https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/10-trends-that-define-the-spring-2022-season,Steff Yotka,https://assets.vogue.in/photos/616e854e5b1891a27019ac41/1:1/w_1600%2Cc_limit/00_promo.jpg,,21 October 2021,,"Follow us By Steff Yotka As the industry snapped back to the usual fashion month rhythms, the collections that stood out after four weeks of runway shows had less to do with garments and more to do with new modes of presenting fashion. As per our seasonal recap, the shows that we will remember from spring 2022 are the lively experiments that redefined what a show could be, like Balenciaga’s The Simpsons episode, Balmain’s music festival, and Marni’s performance piece with an audience fully outfitted in upcycled Marni wares. But what of silhouette, texture and colour, and material development? The emphasis on shows and showiness actually seems to have freed up designers’ thinking when it comes to clothes. We got everything from Grecian draping at Loewe to exposed torsos at Miu Miu and crisp little skirt suits at Christian Dior. Both Marine Serre and Dries Van Noten put an emphasis on you-have-to-touch-it texture while Botter’s Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh and Sunnei’s Loris Messina and Simone Rizzo created sleek surfwear and stripes that come alive on a laptop or phone screen. Thebe Magugu and Luar’s Raul Lopez rethought the trench as the season’s must-have outerwear while Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière and Valentino’s Pierpaolo Piccioli placed their bets on dramatic capes. Rodarte offered holistic sun salutations and Stella McCartney turned mushrooms into bags. Riccardo Tisci perfected the bum-reveal at Burberry while Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta did it with transparent garments that covered up as much as they exposed. Did it all congeal neatly? No, but doesn’t fashion that’s a little all over the place and yet vibrant, exciting, and fearlessly weird feel right for right now? So, here are 10 trends to try for spring. No basics. No boring thoughts. No rehashing territory and not a pantsuit in sight! Spring 2022 is the time to try something new. Do you dare? Maria Grazia Chiuri hit the right note for réentrée dressing at Christian Dior, leaving the structure and volupté of the New Look behind for a spritely slim look first introduced by Marc Bohan at Dior in 1961. At Virginie Viard’s Chanel, a similarly carefree spirit emerged, with models like Quannah Chasinghorse and Vittoria Ceretti camping it up on the runway in classic Chanel suits. Even if the catwalks evoke the ’60s or the ’80s, the look of a short-short skirt and blazer remains thoroughly modern. Just ask Olivia Rodrigo, who has made the skirt suit her preppy, punky signature. Rodarte closed its spring 2022 show with a sun salutation, but the sisters Mulleavy aren’t the only ones with Vitamin D on the mind. Solar shades like gold, bronze, amber, and marigold abound in collections from Proenza Schouler, Chloé, and many others. All the more reason to go outside this spring—with SPF of course. Never has the back view of a garment seemed so essential. At Prada, Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons sliced open the backs of their minidresses and adorned them with long satin trains. Courregès’s Nicolas Di Felice had a similar idea, extending minis several feet behind models, while Louis Vuitton, Rick Owens, and Valentino all showed capes. All the better for making a dramatic exit. Forget collarbones, décolletage, or thighs, fashion’s new erogenous zone is the torso. At Miu Miu, midriffs went from underboob to upper-pube; ditto at Coperni, Isabel Marant, and even Giorgio Armani. But as many have pointed out, fashion’s new crop tops and low-rise pants have become a mode to emphasize thinness—an especially retrograde idea. Props to Maryam Nassir Zadeh, KNWLS, Collina Strada, and Chromat for showing the look on models with curves. Everyone else, please take note! A classic beige trench is a forever wardrobe staple—but the styles shown at Burberry, Thebe Magugu, and Balenciaga are anything but basic. Riccardo Tisci cut out the backs of his trenches; Magugu created one inspired by one his mother wore outside their home in Kimberly, South Africa, and Balencaiga splattered its version with paint and tugged it off the shoulder. Luar’s trench isn’t really a trench at all, but an overcoat cinched with a single leather band. Dua Lipa’s already worn it; will you? Leave it to Marni’s Francesco Risso to get poetic about prints: “Stripes are strongly associated with direction, where daisies are new beginnings and resilience,” he said after his spiritual show. Florals for spring, you know, are not exactly groundbreaking, but his reliance on sinuous bold stripes definitely takes fashion in a new direction. The same goes for Tory Burch’s mid-century color-blocking, Kenneth Ize’s artful woven lines, and Sunnei’s rugby stripes. Schiaparelli’s Daniel Roseberry said his bold red-and-white looks have a “David Lynch holiday” vibe. No blasé nautical tops here! Dimitra Petsa’s wet-look dresses were the look of lockdown, with starlets and It Girls like Gigi Hadid, Yseult, and Kylie Jenner choosing her dripping dresses for red carpets and Instagram posts. Grecian draping has radiated outside Athens, with Rick Owens, Richard Malone, and Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson offering up their own surreal bias pieces on the runway. Think of them as a counter to the overt sexiness of the midriff trend; a subtler way to emphasize the female form. Despite showing their collections as films, both Dries Van Noten and Marine Serre made the case for clothing that has to be touched. Popcorn tops, popular in the ’90s, appeared in both designer’s collections, though credit has to go to the young upstart Chet Lo who has made the feel-good fabric his signature. Elsewhere, Diesel’s Glenn Martens scrunched up denim while Jil Sander, Chopova Lowena, and Undercover put an emphasis on fluff. You’ve got to feel it to believe it. Beachy wetsuits, cute bathing suits, and surfer girl color palettes appeared at Chanel, Botter, Atlein, Anna Sui, and Rejina Pyo. The surfer spirit might be emanating from Venice Beach, where ERL’s Eli Russell Linnetz has made sunkissed and worn-in sweaters a staple of his collection; or maybe it’s coming from Melbourne? The sisters behind Kiko Kostadinov’s womenswear collection channeled their Aussie summers for a collection of seashell-strewn minis and quirky beachwear. Showing your black knickers under a transparent pair of Eckhaus Latta trousers or a Maximilian dress will be the best way to suggest a little sexiness without showing any skin. The shimmering, transparent cyber gray fabric and see-through black and beige are reminiscent of Helmut Lang’s best pieces; no surprise that the new iteration of Helmut Lang’s brand has plenty of sheer panels and bodysuits.

Designer Fashion,"The biggest fashion trends you need to know about for 2022, from 'goddess dressing' to the return of bodycon","The resort collections are a sneak peek into next year, right now",https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/resort-2022-fashion-trends,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a1cfdc58bfe816d3990f/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/cruise.jpg,,,," By Alexandra Fullerton The first reveals of what we’ll be wearing in 2022 have dropped and it’s an understatement to say we are excited. The fashion calendar has been slightly confused of late (thanks panny-D) but June is when designers share their resort, cruise or pre-Spring collections. Not as splashy as the traditional February and September fashion week catwalk shows, resort collections are full of really useful investment pieces that will be truly valid buys for your wardrobe. Originally these collections - which drop in store in November and stay on-sale til the following June - were designed for the super-rich to wear on their winter sun holidays (hence, ‘resort’ or ‘cruise’) but now they are a practical way to get a fix of next season, right now. And at this point in the corona coaster we are all for looking forwards. By Charlie Teather In keeping with the mood that prescriptive trends are over, there is a good sprinkling of perma-trends throughout the collections, meaning that you can make some sustainable choices when you’re shopping (that’s our kind of consumerism.) You thought that Herve Leger’s iconic bandage dresses and the tight, short silhouette of the Nineties were gone for good? Like all fashion classics, they’re ripe for revival. The boldest trend of resort continues summer’s mood for sexy dressing. Body-conscious cuts that skim your shape come in juicy colours, with cut-out details or ruched details ideal for going out-out.Spotted at David Koma, Balmain and Versace Another trend with the feeling of a throw-back, in a good way, is the resurgence of denim which is appearing on everything - not just jeans. Smart dresses, suits, skirts and jackets all get the true blue treatment. And what about your jeans? For resort, the leading silhouette is wide-leg, high-waisted and floor-skimming. They’re a joyful contrast to our locked-down loungewear and tracksuits.Spotted at Alberta Ferretti, Carolina Herrera and Chloe Adding a whimsical new detail into your outfits, without having to switch up your whole wardrobe is what the best trends are about. For resort, fringe is that thing. Add a trim to a skirt, dresses or a sleeve and feel the swish of fabric physically uplift your mood - fashion should always be fun!Spotted at Chloe, Dior and Chanel Sometimes trends are a slow development… shifting on each season… and sometimes a complete curveball comes and disrupts the status quo. You can’t get any further from a tracksuit than a divine chiffon gown, complete with Grecian inspired draping (literally, at Dior, they staged their show at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens.)Spotted at Dior, Alberta Ferretti and Huishan Zhang We spotted super-sized collars in the resort collections but the focus of top-half dressing is moving out, to your shoulders. Whether an elegant curve, a sweet puff or a sci-fi-costume statement, adding a bold shoulder detail to any outfit will add an instant update to your look.Spotted at Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini Designers are savvy enough to know that some of us will need to take baby steps to take us away from our reliance on athlesiure. And so the inclusion of bombers, tracksuit trousers, hoodies, puffers and drawstrings was an expected element of the resort shows. But these aren’t your average grey marl joggers. Ever bolder colours, slogans and neon tones have been splashed over classic athletic silhouettes along with designer trainers to drool over.Spotted at Dior, Philosophy di Lorenzo Serafini and Versace In a world where WFH is the new normal, you’d think that trouser suits would slowly become obsolete. But absence has made the heart grow fonder and tailoring has been a key street style look on attendees at the recent IRL shows. For resort, the trouser suit is slouchier, or shorter. The colours are quirkier and the details more surprising. These are suits to wear with trainers and a t-shirt rather than power heels and a briefcase.Spotted at Alberta Ferretti, Lanvin and Nina Ricci At least we're ready for 2022 in fashion terms...

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. The end of 2021 is sneaking up on us faster than we think, but that really only means we’ll soon be able to get a fresh start on a new year with lots of fresh trends to look forward to. And while we have no idea what TV shows will become the new Bridgerton or Squid Game, or what new type of non-dairy milk we’ll be flavoring our coffee with, we do have some insight into what everyone will be wearing come 2022. Here are nine trends we saw all over the spring 2022 runways during fashion month that we think are also translatable to everyday wear, so you can get started experimenting with how to wear them best right at this every moment. RELATED: We Tried the Top Belt Hacks on TikTok. Here's What Worked (& What Definitely Didn't) Marigold, lemon, buttercup, honey, banana, daffodil—all these beautiful yellow hues and more will be huge in 2022. The best thing about this trend is that you can customize it to fit your style, no matter what that style may be. Test out different shades to see what works best with your coloring, but a general rule of thumb is that warm undertones look best with warmer hues (like honey or butterscotch) while cooler undertones work well with cool shades (like lemon). Shop the trend: Vici Collection top ($52); L I V D top and pants set ($82; $59); J.Crew pants ($118); Banana Republic pants ($149); Alex Mill sweater ($165) Cher Horowitz would be so proud. (And we do suggest using the Clueless heroine as inspiration rather than Heathers.) The modern version of the trend forgoes padded shoulders and double-breast buttons for cropped jackets, most often worn open over a fitted top or bodysuit, and sleek mini skirts with more of a pencil silhouette. Accessorize with lug-sole booties and a chain link necklace or baroque pearls. Shop the trend: Missguided jacket ($66) and skirt ($42); Vero Moda jacket ($89) and skirt ($59); J.Crew blazer ($268) and skirt ($148; $99); Maje blazer ($525) and skirt ($340) High-shine for day is back, friends, and we are obsessed. There were hints of this trend starting up again over the summer, as many folks finally felt comfortable leaving their homes and dressing up to go out again. And we predict those celebratory vibes will have another surge in the new year. Shop the trend: ASOS top ($54; $26); Halogen skirt ($79); Open Edit blazer ($98) and pants ($89); Vince Camuto top ($99); ASOS pants ($121) We’re not talking about actual corsets or lingerie-as-daywear. We’re talking about tops that take inspiration from the waist-defining undergarment that are made from structured fabrics with seams along the bust and down the torso. You can play up the sexy vibes by wearing this trend with a mini skirt or low-rise jeans, or you can give it a posher twist by opting for a corset top that comes with coordinating trousers, almost like a suit. Layer a plain white tee underneath to get a bit more coverage if you’re into a more casual vibe. Shop the trend: Cider ($12); Jaded Rose ($50); Superdown ($54); Free People ($78); Reformation ($148); NBD ($158); Miaou ($249) The early 2000s love-fest isn’t over yet. Tons of spring runways showed even more scarf tops, low-rise jeans and butterfly everything, so if you haven’t jumped on the bandwagon yet, now’s the time to do so. We adore Coterie member Monroe Steele’s denim-on-denim twist on two Y2K favorites (which also feels like a nod to Destiny’s Child or Britney and Justin on the red carpet), and her minimalist accessories help the whole ensemble to look more grown-up and chic than bubblegum pink and patterned pants would. Shop the trend: Cider top ($22); H&M jeans ($30); American Eagle jeans ($40); 8 Other Reasons top ($44); Musier Paris top ($132); Frame jeans ($225) This past summer, we couldn’t scroll through Instagram without seeing multiple bloggers sporting either flowy frocks with cutouts at the waist or slim-fit tops with peekaboo necklines. Even Simone Biles hopped on the trend recently. And those flashes of skin will only continue to grow in popularity as we head into 2022. Last year’s styles will still be en vogue, but expect to see a lot more asymmetrical cuts and intricate layering or weaving detailing in addition to simple keyholes. Shop the trend: Bershka ($46); Topshop ($49); Socialite ($89); Lovers and Friends ($148); LPA ($228) Magenta and forest green, hot pink and cherry red, bright yellow and violet purple—spring 2022 is all about in-your-face color combos that are right on the verge of clashing. The best way to avoid actually looking like you got dressed in the dark is to stick to solid hues for a sort of custom color-blocked outfit. Best to keep your accessories simple as well. Shop the trend: ASOS sweater ($36); Stradivarius blazer ($60); Express blazer ($138); Susana Monaco bodysuit ($168); Camila Coelho pants ($188); AS by DF pants ($416) Shorter hemlines are replacing the midi dress craze of the past few years, and we’re actually really into it. There are lots of ways to make this trend work for you, whether you prefer a sporty pleated tennis skirt or a slick leather mini or even a flowy mini tent dress. And if you’re not too keen on showing quite so much leg, add a pair of logo-adorned or polka dot tights for some extra coverage that’s still on trend. Shop the trend: J.Crew Factory ($75; $50); Madewell ($80); L’Academie ($158); Ted Baker London ($259; $194); La Ligne ($295) Back in early 2020 fringe was expected to be one of the biggest trends of the year. We all know how that turned out. But it has held on and is back for a second attempt in spring 2022, this time with more of a western-glam twist. Rather than deal with super-long silky fringe and requires more detangling and brushing than your hair, or stereotypical suede fringe on some cowboy boots, the latest take on the trim is to combine the two aesthetics for something in between. Think a white leather trucker jacket with coordinating fringe around the top or a pencil skirt with zig-zag fringe at the hem. Shop the trend: Lulus pants ($54); Rails top ($218); Nanushka top ($375); Understated Leather jacket ($493) RELATED: How to Style a Sweater Vest in 2021 So You Look Chic, Not Dowdy Enter your registered email below!","Trending Share These Will Be the Only 9 Trends You’ll Want to Buy in 2022, According to a Fashion Editor  1.

,"From egg shell heels to demon basketball bags, the 9 wildest accessories of spring/summer 2022",,https://www.vogue.in/fashion/gallery/from-egg-shell-heels-to-demon-basketball-bags-the-9-wildest-accessories-of-spring-summer-2022,Vogue,https://assets.vogue.in/photos/615f21f25c25eba05fcaf383/1:1/w_1600%2Cc_limit/trends22.png,,12 October 2021,,"Follow us By Vogue Minimalists need not apply You couldn’t swing a Fendace choker at the spring/summer 2022 shows without hitting a talking point accessory. From London, where Richard Quinn presented faintly sinister frilled bonnets, to Paris, where Loewe models teetered around the equestrian arena at La Garde Républicaine on soap bar, nail polish and eggshell heels, the mood was anything but understated. Scroll for some of the wildest accessories guaranteed to appear on your Instagram feed next season. The Matthew Williams x Josh Smith collab introduced bottom-grazing boots and Grim Reaper hoodies to Givenchy, but nowhere was the creative union more experimental than on the handbags. From the milk carton clutches and petrol can objets to the demon basketball bags that looked like Wilson if he had been Cast Away for eternity, these were talking-point accessories-cum-art pieces. The smartest investment will be the Kenny, named after Miss Jenner, of course. “It’s a moment of experimentation,” Jonathan Anderson explained of his newly eclectic Loewe vision. “If you’re going to reset after this period, you need to allow a moment to birth a new aesthetic.” The exquisitely crafted heels of the stilettos in the spring/summer 2022 collection were nothing like we’ve seen before – featuring cracked eggs, bars of soap, bottles of nail polish and delicate roses. Fashion East newcomer Chet Lo wowed crowds with his colourful swimwear, but it was his sea creature totes, fashioned from his signature spiky knit fabric, that stole the show. To round off his debut London Fashion Week collection, he sent out a showstopper gargantuan shoulder bag that’s made to fit all your holiday essentials – and more. Although, it would certainly test cabin baggage restrictions. The wildest accessory of them all? Burberry’s Bambi earpieces, no doubt. Soon to be a TikTok phenomenon, the droopy ears were created from a silicone that replicates the feel of human skin. Inspired by the emotional expressions that animals convey through their ears, Riccardo Tisci wanted to simulate how interlinked we all are. “We are born from animals,” he said. “We have an animal instinct that’s highly strung when we are feeling happiness or depression or sadness.” If the diving masks that appeared in Botter’s spring/summer 2022 film made you feel uncomfortable, that was the objective. In a collection entitled “Global Warning”, the scuba headgear – teamed with umbrella hats that also made a splash – symbolised the apocalyptic world we could be heading towards if we don’t address the climate crisis now. For Moschino’s New York Fashion Week show, Scott took us on a riotous romp down memory lane; transforming the nursery rhymes of our childhoods into adorable high fashion. “Maybe it’s our secret craving for comfort for our hearts; the nostalgia of childhood; the love of being wrapped up in a blanket… that security,” said Scott of his sugar-coated spring/summer 2022 collection. A key campy motif? The lamb from, you guessed it, “Mary Had A Little Lamb”. Try and get that out of your head while you check out its reincarnation in handbag form. Richard Quinn’s spring/summer 2022 show was a departure from his trademark gimp-masked, bondage-inspired world. He delivered less latex and more frills, including the Little Bo Peep bonnets that framed models’ faces. Hoodie naysayers, these ruffled confections are for you. “We’re calling some of the spring/summer 2022 necklaces train tracks, because the diamanté and pearls almost look like kids’ braces,” explained Simone Rocha of her haute orthodontic accessories. Even more oddly beguiling? The porcelain baby teeth suspended on gold hoop earrings. Something to chew over before they drop next season, perhaps. Umbrella hats were a mood, as designers weathered the tide of the show cycle again. Nowhere were they more appealing than at Schiaparelli, where Daniel Roseberry paired his brollies with face-framing ornate earrings. Look out, too, for his six-pack totes, which are the everyday way to channel Kim Kardashian’s rippling Hulk dress. Phwoar.

The Dior ready-to-wear spring/summer 2022 collection is all set to roll out its physical runway show at Paris Fashion Week once again. Always a spectacle, with messages of feminism, art tapestries and craft at the forefront, this time, creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri enlisted veteran artist, Anna Paparatti. A key figure of the 1960s art scene in Rome, the artist will work her eclectic magic on the sets of the Dior spring/summer 2022 show, inspired by Rome’s legendary Piper Club.

Fashion Trends,12 epic summer fashion trends to see you through the (apparent!) incoming September heatwave,Is it too late to be hoping for a summer miracle?,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/spring-summer-2021-fashion-trends,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61389012f5e39d30c69b2ff2/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gettyimages-1277583507_sq.png,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather Just as we were all getting used to the 28°C heat around mid-July and revelling in the eventual arrival of summer, the sun seemingly packed up its bags and ever since we've been trying to remember where we arrogantly packed away our waterproof jackets. But while the opportunity for that 'long hot summer' we were hoping for may be quickly slipping away, there's still (apparently) a September heatwave on its way to look forward to - and we'd happily settle for a short hot summer right now. We like to think we deserve it... Unlike previous years - when we'd have enjoyed a a family break around Easter, have looked forward to a big girls' holiday in August and enjoying lots of dinners with big groups of friends outside or inside a restaurant - our 2021 calendar has so far been looking somewhat scarce. But while the world is still in varying degrees of standstill, the UK has managed to stay true to its ambitious (and slightly delayed) roadmap out of lockdown and we've seen an easing of almost all restrictions over recent months. And while the last year has conditioned us not to get complacent and taught us all that we have little idea about what the future holds, thanks to the ever-reliable forward-thinking nature of the fashion world we at least had some view of what this summer would look like. Or, rather, what our wardrobes would look like. By Charlie Teather True to form, albeit in a very different format, last September saw some of the world's biggest and most influential fashion houses put on their spring/summer 2021 showcase in order to convey the new season's sartorial forecast. Debuting fresh takes on the world's current favourite looks as well as entirely new trends, it provided editors and fans with an insight as to the proposed fashion landscape. Whether you're wearing these looks to safely celebrate a lift on lockdown, or for a quick mirror selfie to keep the Instagram feed ticking before heading straight back into those trusty tracksuit bottoms, this is a judgement-free zone.

Remember a few years ago when we all tried (and many failed) to master the floss? Well thankfully this season's incarnation is much easier to get to grips with, as it requires far less physical coordination and little more than a bare-midriff and some thin straps of fabric to succeed.Spotted at: (L-R) Jacquemus, Acne Studios and Michael Kors - as well as, Versace, Supriya Lele, Paco Rabanne, Charlotte Knowles and 16 Arlington One of the biggest colour trends of the SS21 runways was, in fact, a lack of colour altogether. Black and white pieces were everywhere, and lend themselves perfectly to that feeling of renewal as we kick off our fresh new loungewear-free (eek) aesthetic.Spotted at: (L-R) Ports 1961, Chanel and Gabriela Hearst - as well as Prada, Christopher John Rogers, Loewe, Giambattista Valli and Proenza Schouler One of the sexiest trends of this spring, bare backs are the perfect way to show a little (or a lot of) skin for those who tend to prefer keeping their legs/décolletage/waist under wraps. Opt for a subtle, billowing fabric for a more tentative take, or go full-throttle via strapped, form-fitting pieces.Spotted at: (L-R) Hermes, Acne Studios and Gabriela Hearst - as well as Nanushka and Victoria Beckham A trend that can be interpreted in many ways depending on the situation we find ourselves in, the sheer gown is the perfect throw-over piece as you leave the beach for the day (okay, we're dreaming) but works equally well over a slip dress for an at-home date night or even as a v. sexy pyjama alternative for a particularly special night in.Spotted at: (L-R) Valentino, Alberta Ferretti and Dior - as well as, Chanel, Emporio Armani, Sportmax and Miu Miu This trend has reappeared for the last couple of seasons, but summer 2021's incarnation sees more variety in its offering. Wear yours alone with shorts on holiday (fingers crossed those happen at some point), with high-waisted trousers for a dinner or as a layer over the top of dresses, shirts or tops for a more contemporary aesthetic.Spotted at: (L-R) Dior, Jacquemus and Simone Rocha - as well as Alberta Ferretti, Isabel Marant, Moschino, Marques Almeida and Tom Ford What was perhaps initially a trend conjured up in the semi-naive hope it would be perfect for post-lockdown frolics, SS21's obsession with sparkle and shine will - if nothing else - perk up Zoom calls 15+ months into working-from-home. We certainly need it.Spotted at: (L-R) Balmain, Isabel Marant and Louis Vuitton - as well as Loewe, Saint Laurent, Burberry, Valentino and Chanel Another trend that was big for AW20 and is sticking around is the cut-out. More often spotted at the hips, but also often placed at the neckline or across the stomach, these are more alternative ways to flash the flesh for those growing tired of the traditional cleavage-or-legs option.Spotted at: (L-R) Kenzo, Gabriela Hearst and Paco Rabanne - as well as Fendi, Prada, MSGM, Zimmermann, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi and Carolina Herrera One of the more unusual trends to emerge for this season, netting finds its way into our wardrobes via everything from closely-knit dresses and vests to throw-over layers which add little more than a bit of intrigue and texture. Those not keen on flashing certain areas ought to also invest in some good-coverage lingerie.Spotted at: (L-R) Ports 1961, Acne Studios and Burberry - as well as Paco Rabanne, Fendi, Hermes, Valentino and Balenciaga Fans of the puffed sleeve will be thrilled to see its appearance here, as will those with a penchant for all things OTT because this season the bold shoulder is bigger than ever. Just make sure it cuts off at the elbow or above to avoid being drowned beneath swathes of fabric.Spotted at: (L-R) Philosophy, Isabel Marant and Loewe - as well as Altuzarra, Khaite, Carolina Herrera, Givenchy and Balmain While black and white may have been one of the most stand-out colour trends this season, right at the other end of the spectrum we see fuchsia come to play. Crucially, there's nothing tentative or careful about this pink. Layer varying shades on top of one another and you can't be afraid to make a statement.Spotted at: (L-R) Valentino, Isabel Marant and Molly Goddard - as well as Halpern, Christopher John Rogers and Roksanda Good news for those of us who have spent the best part of a year in tracksuit bottoms, this season's trouser shape of choice is a very relaxed affair. Admittedly they don't have elastic waists, but the hemlines are wide enough to disguise you footwear beneath - great news if you're finding it hard to break up with your slippers.Spotted at: (L-R) Sportmax, Louis Vuitton and Chanel - as well as The Row, Chloé, Max Mara, Fendi, Stella McCartney and Tom Ford It wouldn't be a contemporary trend list without the mention of a face mask, would it? Whether you opt for one that matches the rest of your #lewk or something a little more unusual, please make sure it's actually doing its job. Style over substance is not a cute trend for SS21.Spotted at: (L-R) Anna Sui, Christian Siriano and Bora Aksu SEE MORE STORIES More from GLAMOUR UK © Condé Nast Britain 2022.",12 epic summer fashion trends to see you through the (apparent!) incoming September heatwave Here are the 12 SS21 trends that we'll all be jumping on board with... as soon as the sun reappears.

,Butt-Protecting Fashion Is the Spring Trend We Didn't See Coming,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/butt-protecting-fashion-miniskirt-train-trend,,,,,,"Typically, spring and summer aren't the most practical seasons when it comes to fashion. In years past, we've found ourselves wobbling down cobblestone streets wearing wedge sandals, struggling to figure out strappy bikini tops, and had our fair share of Marilyn Monroe dress moments due to rogue gusts of wind. However, in 2022, we might just have a solution for a major seasonal struggle we know all too well: sitting down on a scorching hot — or even a questionably clean — seat and burning the backs of our bare legs. Long trains, attached to both skirts and shirts, were a trend we spotted on a handful of Spring '22 runways, turning butt-protection clothing in to an actual thing. In some cases, these trains were a twist on the high-low look that takes us back to the early '00s. However, at Chanel, they came in the form of an additional flap. Basically the mud flap you'd see behind the tires of a semi truck but oddly chic. Either way, we're all for making this small switch next year, solving at least one dilemma on our list. RELATED: Shoving Your Clutch in Your Pants Is Now Fashion Week Approved Chanel is famous for these sweet little suits, but the train on the back of this skirt adds a whole new element of fun — and practicality — for the warmer weather months. RELATED: Busy Philipps Says Tap Shorts and Boots Are Essentials When Living in New York Not only does this elaborate skirt work as a statement piece in an otherwise simple look, it'll save your legs when sliding into a car with leather seats. It's not just Spring 2022's skirt selection that included trains, either. This breezy, butt-protecting mullet top appeared on Louis Vuitton's runway, giving us another smart, breezy option to add to our wardrobe.","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us Butt-Protecting Fashion Is the Spring Trend We Didn't See Coming Chanel Prada Louis Vuitton Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

London Fashion Week,5 trends from London Fashion Week that we'll all be wearing next spring and beyond,Anyone else fancy fast-forwarding to next summer?,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/london-fashion-week-spring-summer-2021-fashion-trends,Annabelle Spranklen ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/613897c93335302f7261ae72/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/untitled-1_sf.jpg,,,," By Annabelle Spranklen We know, it might feel like a bit of a weird time to be looking ahead to next year’s spring/summer fashion trends when 2020 is still proving to be one of the biggest roller-coasters of our lifetime (as we write this the restrictions and measures surrounding Covid have tightened up again for six months). However, if fashion month so far has taught us anything, it’s that we should keep looking ahead with an open mind. We had no idea what to expect from London Fashion Week this season and yet it seems nothing has got in the way of creativity. If anything, the shows so far have proved that designers have embraced the turbulent times, head on, creating smaller collections during lockdown with a greater emphasis on wearability and longevity. Finally, a fashion week where designers are less focused on creating one season wonders that ruin the planet and more towards evergreen trends that we'll keep coming back to. With a predominantly digital showing, some brands like Burberry went for a merge between a real show and an online one, live-streamed from the British countryside without any physical attendees but with a pre-show chat hosted by musician and actor Erykah Badu, all hosted on video site Twitch. Victoria Beckham cancelled her planned ‘salon-style’ catwalk show and instead showed her collection to groups of just three visitors at a time, where guests were handed a Monogrammed silk “VB” face mask. Meanwhile, Bora Aksu was one of the very few designers to show to a real life audience, with models donning organza face masks and guests perched on their own park bench in a Covent Garden church garden. Much like the steer towards making the shows more practical, the collections themselves had the same appeal. Many of spring summer 2021's trends aren't anything new instead they're recycled - trends we've seen before that are largely easy-wearing and versatile. Pieces you can easily slip into for a night out or night in. After a year of many formal occasions being cancelled or postponed, many of us have missed the thrill of wearing something extra special. Thankfully, London Fashion Week has shown us we have heaps to look forward to next year with some designers still heralding the age of dressing up. Grown-up chic, timeless pieces worth investing in that you'll love year after year. A far cry from throwaway fashion as they'll ever be. Here are a few of the trends we spotted during London Fashion Week that we'll all be wearing as soon as spring 2021 hits (and hopefully long after...) As seen at: Emilia Wickstead, Fashion East, Molly GoddardThe crop top trend seems to be sticking around. Emilia Wickstead showed us the art of how to flash your midriff in a really chic and elegant way (far removed from the 90s girl band look) teaming with high-waisted skirts. A more laid-back knitted bralet style were paraded at Fashion East and Molly Goddard. As seen at: 16Artlington, Victoria Beckham, Phoebe EnglishIn a nod to our new low-key working-from-home wardrobes, brands like 16Atlington, better-known for its often OTT red-carpet drama and Victoria Beckham, whose collections often tend to steer towards sharp tailoring, showed that pared-back is in style. Slinky silk dresses embraced a ""satiny-slouch"" feel along with fluid dress and trouser shapes. As seen at: Victoria Beckham, Erdem, Molly Goddard, BurberryZingy and mossy shades of green cropped up several times in London’s Spring 2021 presentations. From Victoria Beckham’s apple green trousers to the emerald green skirts and ruffled dresses at Molly Goddard, the satin fern heels at Emilia Wickstead and the silk printed dresses at Burberry, it looks like this might be our big shade next season. As seen at: Victoria BeckhamVictoria Beckham reportedly spent most of lockdown in vintage denim and the theme seems to be running through her 2021 collection, with low-slung, easy-wearing vintage style jeans making a comeback, a trend we are so on board with. As seen at: Simone Rocha, Molly Goddard, Erdem, Preen by Thornton BregazziWhile some designers opted for more pared-back looks in a nod to the last few months, some emphasised that dressing up is back and better than ever because if you’re going out, why not go ALL OUT? Simone Rocha’s was all about hugging the female form, with sumptuous fabrics and A-line, Elizabethan shapes while nipped-in-waists dominated at Erdem. Femine bows, puff sleeves and ruffles popped up all over Molly Goddard and Preen by Thornton Bregazzi’s collections.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. We don’t always think of winter as the most stylish of seasons. Outside of New Year’s and holiday looks, it can be tough not to fall into a pattern of simply wearing the same dark-wash jeans and gray cashmere sweaters day in and day out. But this year we’re determined to add a little extra flair to our cold-weather looks, and thanks to Pinterest and the global shopping platform Lyst, now we know exactly where to start. Both have seen major increases in interest in these seven trends, and we suspect that excitement will only continue to grow. So, if you too want to give your wardrobe a stylish boost, here are the only seven winter fashion trends you need to know. RELATED: 16 Puffer Coats That Won't Make You Look (& Feel) Like a Marshmallow Most winters we find ourselves stuck in a bit of a drab color rut, but not this time. Both Pinterest and Lyst saw major increases in searches for cold weather looks that pack a punch in bold colors like hot pink, violet, lime green or red. You don’t need to wear them from head-to-toe if that’s not you jam, but try adding a touch of something attention-grabbing, like a bright yellow sweater atop your go-to jeans, to switch things up. Shop the trend: ASOS Design sweater ($50; $43); Express blazer ($138; $97); Banana Republic pants ($149); Susanna Monaco bodysuit ($168); Naadam cardigan ($175); Camila Coelho pants ($188); Raquel Allegra dress ($275); Dannijo dress ($276) We’ve been loving the shacket (a shirt/jacket combo) for a few years now, but things are really picking up heading into 2022. And while we’ll always have a soft spot for the classic wool plaid designs, other styles are also trending, including leather and shearling, so you can be sure there is a shacket out there that will fit seamlessly into your existing wardrobe. Shop the trend: Collusion ($41); Thread & Supply ($49); ASOS Curve ($64); Old Navy ($70); Sanctuary ($139); Wilfred Free ($228) Faux-leather leggings have long been a staple in our winter rotation, but this year is all about faux-leather pants instead. The most popular versions are cut with a straight leg and are either black or some wonderfully bold color, like red or olive green. Wear them with posh classics, like a slim-fit crewneck sweater or button-up shirt, to tamper the natural rockstar vibes of the leather. Shop the trend: Open Edit ($59); AFRM ($78); More to Come ($80); Wilfred ($148); Lovers and Friends ($210); ASOS Design ($248) Knee-high boots will never really be out of style, but this winter they’re at the very top of our shopping list as a must-have item, rather than just a basic staple. The best options truly are basic, featuring structured leather or suede (no slouching here) in black or brown with minimal detailing (embossed croc scales or a riding boot strap at the ankle are great, fringe down the sides or gold cape toes are not). Wear them with skinny jeans or leggings and a tailored blazer or with skirts or dresses that hit at least two inches above the top of your boots. Shop the trend: Journee Collection ($77); Steve Madden ($190; $114); Chinese Laundry ($160); Sam Edelman ($225); Vince Camuto ($230); Schutz ($238) Waist-cinching belts, neon color blocking and high-collared puffers aren’t just for ‘80s theme parties anymore. Yup, throwback ski gear is back for another round, both on and off the slopes. Be sure to pair your belted puff with more modern separates—like straight-leg snow pants over super-slim styles or wide-leg jeans instead of stirrup leggings—to avoid looking like you’re wearing a costume. Shop the trend: J.Crew ($198; $80); Levi’s ($150; $99); BDG ($119); Free People ($368); Bobo Choses ($390); Free People ($648) Sweater dresses will forever be one of our absolute favorite ways to combine comfort and style, but they’re having a particular flash of popularity as we navigate between venturing out into the world again while still spending a lot of time at home. This time around, looser, flowier silhouettes are the most-wanted over curve-hugging styles. The trick to making them look chic instead of dowdy? Add a thin belt at the waist and keep your accessories sleek and minimal. Shop the trend: ASOS Design ($55); Charles Henry ($89); Daily Practice by Anthropologie ($140); J.Crew ($148); Theory ($495; $199); Halston ($545) This winter is less about prints and patterns and more about adding depth to your look with textures. Feathers, shearling, embellishments and chunky knitting are all fun options, but so are croc embossed scales or raised woodgrain effects. This is a particularly great trend for those who prefer neutral hues or monochrome dressing as a way to spice things up without going too far outside your wheelhouse. Shop the trend: Nina bag ($78); Anthropologie sweater ($120); Blank NYC jacket ($128); Hutch top ($160); Sleeper pajamas ($290); UGG jacket ($298) RELATED: The One Vintage-Inspired Accessory You’ll See Everywhere This Holiday Season, According to Etsy Enter your registered email below!","Trending Share The Top 7 Winter Fashion Trends to Know Going Into 2022  1.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Ah, spring shopping. The promise of fresh, balmy weather and a chance to shed our cashmere in exchange for a fresh crop of spring frocks and chunky sandals. (Is it just us, or does the spring fashion elicit even more excitement than fall?) Thankfully, with the new rise of tempting trends—like these four must-haves below—comes Affirm: A simpler way to pay for your investment purchases this year. Never heard of this magical service? Well, here’s the gist: Affirm is a new a payment alternative to credit cards. Essentially, it allows you to split your purchases into easy bi-weekly or monthly payments, giving you the flexibility to pay over time. Affirm has partnered with thousands of retailers, so once you add items to your cart, all you need to do is select “Affirm” as your payment option at checkout and you’ll see exactly what you owe upfront. Unlike some credit card companies and other services, Affirm will never charge you late or hidden fees—which means those spring investment pieces are now more accessible than ever. Ready to get started? Here’s what’s on our shopping list. Loafers are *the* fashion-forward shoe trend of spring 2021. Why’s that? Because they go with everything from shorts to dresses and they’re super comfortable. The rise in popularity of this slightly dorky shoe style can be directly linked to the backless loafer trend that’s been unshakable over the past few years (yes, we’re looking at you, Gucci). But this year’s version has evolved from the sleek backless slide to a decidedly chunkier thick sole and, yes, has full heel coverage.  ($42/month with Affirm*) ($42/month with Affirm*) ($42/month with Affirm*) ($43/month with Affirm*) Miranda Priestly may find them blasé, but spring florals are a classic we all look forward to sporting year after year after year. For the updated version on the trend, it’s all about mixing and matching dainty daisies with delicate blooms in more muted hues (as opposed to sticking to just one pattern, like vibrant tropical palms).  ($39.98/month with Affirm*) ($21.65/month with Affirm*) ($46.65/month with Affirm*) ($29.98/month with Affirm*) Think more along the lines of Onitsuka Tiger, rather than chunky ’90s styles. Folks are upgrading their WFH sweatsuits and thick-soled dad sneakers for more streamlined trackpants, sleek anoraks and sporty kicks with a vintage vibe. Fashion houses showcased styles paired with oversize dresses in a multitude of colors (a look we absolutely stand by), but these will look equally good with some raw-hem cropped jeans and an oversize blouse for a more casual vibe.  ($26.66/month with Affirm*) ($28.33/month with Affirm*) ($33.33/month with Affirm*) ($23.33/month with Affirm*) Like many people, you’ve spent the last 11 months almost exclusively in leggings, sweatshirts, T-shirts and joggers. Pretty much anything stretchy and comfortable and as far away from structured grown-up clothes as possible. But amidst a sea of cotton, fleece and spandex, one outfit has risen above the pack to become my most-worn look of the past year: The matching set. Continue rocking it for as long as you can with these luxe upgrades.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. It’s almost time to ring in the a new year, and with it comes a whole slew of hot new fashion trends to mix in with our existing wardrobes. But there is one trend in particular that we predict will be by far the most popular: bold color combos. Yup, bright, vibrant, “look at me!” ensembles are ousting our go-to winter neutrals in 2022 and we’re pretty darn excited. According to the global shopping platform Lyst, searches for feel-good shades like hot pink, yellow, orange and green, as well as terms like “colorful” and “rainbow” have been steadily rising as we head into the new year. But the real reason we predict that this trend, more than, say, leather pants or cut-out detailing, will be the one we see more than any other is because it’s just so easy to wear. Most influencers embracing the trend are posting outfits in head-to-toe Barbie pink or a mish-mosh of vibrant hues, but you don’t need to go all out to pull it off. A small splash of bright yellow by way of a mini handbag or a lime green sweater peeking out from beneath your beloved gray wool winter coat is equally as chic and trendy. That said, we recognize that swapping your usual black cashmere for a bright red version can be intimidating for some. So, what’s the best way to rock the bold color trend? Start small and stick with solid hues over prints or patterns. Try a violet purple headband or bright blue pumps à la Carrie Bradshaw. For the sartorially advanced, we still suggest opting for solid hues, but have fun mixing and matching to create your own color-blocked ensemble. And don’t be afraid to mix warm tones with cool (we adore the idea of a buttery yellow paired with a deep violet). So long as you wear it with confidence, you’ll look fabulous. (Although if you are a little worried about mixing to contrasting hues, add a neutral piece in between, like black pants or blue-wash jeans, as a stylish buffer.) Now that you’re well versed in 2022’s top fashion trend, here are 12 pieces to start playing with before the new year even starts. RELATED: The Top 7 Winter Fashion Trends to Know Going Into 2022 There are a whopping 22 colors to choose from, all just as cozy, comfy and trendy as the next. Buy it ($118) Available in sizes XXS to 3X Wear this bright blue blazer over a black sweater dress for a more muted look, or go all out with the matching pants and an equally colorful yellow blouse. Buy it ($79) Available in sizes 14 to 20 Green is a surprisingly easy color to wear, and this particular shade looks gorgeous on just about every skin tone. Buy it ($148) Available in sizes XXS to XL This bag may be small, but that uber-bright pink definitely packs a punch. Buy it ($150) Combine the bold color trend with Y2K revival by way of a cute one-shoulder tank. Tuck it into some easy, straight-leg jeans and add clogs or another slip-on shoe to keep things modern and mature. Buy it ($46) Available in sizes XXS to XL Not quite sure how to best mix and match different shades? Look for pieces like this cardigan dress that do all the work for you, then opt for neutral accessories to finish the fit. Buy it ($165) Available in sizes XS to XL Wear this breezy frock now with tights and black over-the-knee boots, then swap in some colorful sandals for summer. Buy it ($32; $26) Available in sizes 2 to 10 Another hot trend for 2022? Cut-out knits. This top combines an open neck with vibrant cherry red for a real win-win purchase, plus it’s also bra-friendly. Buy it ($35) Available in sizes 14 to 24 This bag was everywhere in 2021, but it is still a great investment in 2022, especially if you opt for a brighter hue like this Kelly green. Buy it ($89; $68) Another way to ease yourself into sporting bold colors from head to toe is to swap a neutral base for a pastel hue, like this lime green dress. Then pile on all the super-bright accessories (like those amazing fringe sandals) to really amp things up. Buy it ($329) Available in sizes XS to L Hot pink is another surprising universally flattering shade that is sure to bring in all the compliments. Buy it ($82) Available in sizes 0 to 14 For those who prefer just to dip a toe into trends, you can never go wrong with a classic knotted headband.

Dresses,Slip dresses are a huge fashion trend for summer but also ideal for layering in the winter – these are our favourites to add to your year-round wardrobe,Fashion's favourite slip dress is fuss-free and fabulous.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/best-slip-dresses,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/613895a32b5bbea008291f1d/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/eleanorbarkes_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton Yes, they’re inspired by the sinuous lines of a traditional petticoat or nightie but it’s not such a stretch to take the slip dress out of the boudoir. A red carpet fave from the 1930s onwards (referencing Jean Harlow in bias cut silk) right through to Hailey, Kendall and Bella’s off-duty style today, the slip is easy, fuss-free and perpetually chic. Just slip it on and go - it’s our kind of styling. We found 21 versions of the fashion pack's favourite dress that you can wear all summer long - and beyond. Heavier-weight fabrics, patterns and prints will ensure your dress doesn’t get mistaken for lingerie (although underwear as outerwear is always a perma-trend.) Your choice of trainers, sandals or heels will totally transform the mood of a slip dress too - and don’t think they’re a summer-only fashion option. Layer your slip dress over a white t-shirt for iconic Nineties style or slide a blazer over the top if you’re heading out for drinks. When it gets cold, chunky boots and a cardigan (add a belt for definition) would mean you get more wear from your purchase which is always a tick for sustainability. Slip dresses can look devastatingly elegant in dark coloured satin or totally grungy in a ditsy floral (with Doc Martens or Vans). You can make them cutesy in mini length or sexy with a lace trim. By Charlie Teather If you are looking for a designer buy, Bottega Veneta’s knitted belted style would be top of our wishlist while Acne’s denim-look dress is totally unique. On the high street, ASOS’s sweet mini-dress comes in summer’s perfect gingham print and Monki’s short sunflower print dress is made from recycled fabric. If you fancy a bright block colour, Whistles’ royal blue dress or & Other Stories’ sunshine yellow style are ideal. Right now we can’t think of any other item that is so versatile, whatever your personal style!

Fashion Trends,"'Rainbow maximalism' is the fashion trend dominating TikTok, and it could be the secret to faking that summer feeling right now",Because this weather really isn't doing it for us.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/rainbow-fashion-trend-tiktok,Hannah Tappin ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a80d5ebdbf876576baf4/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/nxcva_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Hannah Tappin For what feels like an eternity, many of us have been dreaming of brighter days. The last few months have had many of us feeling a bit blue, so what better way to celebrate the easing of relentless lockdown restrictions than with an optimistic attitude and a colourful, rainbow filled wardrobe? Naturally - what with it being dominated by confident, fashion-forward Gen Zs and millennials - TikTok was one of the first platforms to champion this look, with the rainbow maximalism colour trend blowing up all over the feed just in time for restrictions easing this spring. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. For far too long, neutral minimalism has dominated in fashion. While you undoubtedly can’t go wrong with a nude staple (just look at Kim K and Rosie-Huntington Whiteley's Instagram feeds to prove how sartorially inspirational it can be), but for those of us growing a bit tired of it this change couldn’t come soon enough. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Bringing some much-needed colour to our outfits and giving our wardrobes a new lease of life, TikTok seems to be starting a very welcome fashion revolution right now. Whether it’s striking neon accessories, colour pop accents, contrasting pieces or pretty pastel hues, we're calling it: rainbow colour is in and neutral minimalism is out. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. After the year we’ve had, it’s no surprise that we’re so drawn to colour. Especially now that we're allowed to plan (outdoor) occasions and dress for actually(!) leaving the house. So why not dress to get noticed? The fact that it’s trending proves how much we are all pining after a more colourful life as soon as is safe to do so, so why not start with our fashion choices? This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Don’t just take our word for it, the existence of colour therapy can vouch for the fact that colour has the power to seriously boost your mood, emotional state and perception by others. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Keen to get in on the action? A fashion cult favourite - and TikTok IT-girl go-to - is the brand House of Sunny. Priding themselves on ‘Emulating Good vibes and positive energy’, the focus of their latest drop is to ‘have you feeling completely loved up’. Think mesmerising, zesty green swirl prints, cloudy pastel midi dresses and 70s inspired, marble, multi-coloured flares. Swoon. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. If the past year has taught us anything it’s that life is short, so wear exactly what you like. No matter how bold, bright or daring. It seems that when it comes to post-lockdown fashion, it’s go big or go home. Scroll down for our pick of the best rainbow buys to shop right now...

Fashion Trends,Milkmaid dresses are the universally flattering fashion trend that will seamlessly take your wardrobe from summer to autumn,Sign. Us. Up.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/milkmaid-dresses-fashion-trend,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a98d1145ea59e77e7110/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/claudia_berresford_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather When it comes to dresses, there are those of us who absolutely live in them and others who just can't seem to make them work. Sure, they're easy to throw on for a night out or for dinner with friends, but when it comes to a more casual, daytime look a whole new approach is required. Which is why so many find jeans a much easier go-to... But what if we told you that the world of daywear dresses actually requires the simplest formula of all? Unlike eveningwear - which welcomes everything from minis to maxis, slips to serious gowns, silk to chiffon, cotton to linen - there's one style of dress that's not only appropriate for just about every day but also universally flattering. We are, of course, referring to the milkmaid dress. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. While you may not have known until 0.5 seconds ago that that's what this style is called, you're no doubt familiar with these dresses; if not from your own wardrobe then certainly from your Instagram feed. Puffed-sleeves, square - or sweetheart - neckline and usually mid-length (although the minis are also super cute), the milkmaid dress has been the unofficial sponsor of summer dressing for the last couple of years, but did you also know that it's a great transitional piece as we move from summer - if you can call it that? - into autumn. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. While you may know it best worn with a pair of sandals and SPF, this dress is also incredibly chic when paired with a boot - particularly a cowboy boot, but we know those can be divisive - and a cropped jacket that finishes right where the usually-shirred waist of the dress does. By Charlie Teather Of course, being one of the most popular and flattering styles around, the options are seemingly endless on both the high street and designer ends of the spectrum. Fear not, however, as we've done all the whittling down for you, and have come up with our edit of the 28 best milkmaid dresses worth snapping up pronto...

Kim Jones showcased a star-studded model lineup at Fendi (and his first-ever womenswear show), calling on mother-daughter powerhouse Kate and Lila Grace Moss to join his A-list catwalk, also starring Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Demi Moore. Meanwhile, at just 24 years old, Charles de Vilmorin became one of the youngest designers to join the schedule with an eye-poppingly colourful genderless collection. There was plenty of inspiration for lockdown reemergence too (find a recap of couture SS21’s biggest fashion trends here), including standout footwear. If you can tear your eyes away from Schiaparelli’s sculptured breastplates and knit dresses clad with 200,000 Swarovski crystals, don’t miss artistic director Daniel Roseberry’s surrealist platforms with gold-dipped toes. Over at Valentino, Pierpaolo Piccioli teamed neutral capes with glam-rock platform boots and glossy Mary Janes. Meanwhile, continuing the theatrical spirit, New York’s Area put a couture spin on diamond-encrusted clogs, studded square-toe thong sandals and backless loafers. Here are eight mesmerising, high-drama shoes we loved from the runways of Couture Fashion Week SS21.

Fashion,10 breakout fashion brands we guarantee you'll be seeing everywhere in 2022,Time to get clued up ahead of everyone else.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/fashion-brands-to-know-2022,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61b9ae59983121fb0be869b8/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/BREAKOUTFASHION151221_DEFAULT.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather It's not been an easy couple of years for the fashion industry. Fashion brands have had to pivot dramatically – what with red carpets cancelled, celebrity appearances seemingly a thing of the past, runway shows forbidden and an enormous decline in people actually buying clothes (as, frankly, there was nowhere to wear them) – and figure out new ways of drumming up attention and, in turn, custom. Where some struggled, however, others triumphed. By tapping into social media, many breakout fashion brands were able to connect with a whole new fanbase - and eventual customer - by discussing thought-provoking topics, providing a new take on BTS context, and serving up aspirational light-relief to brighten our feeds (and our days). By Charlie Teather So which labels triumphed? Global fashion shopping platform Lyst has done some digging, and discovered which up-and-coming fashion houses have been getting us all talking, searching and shopping in 2021… This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Nensi Dojaka is quickly becoming *the* go-to designer for ‘OUT out’ outfits. Loved by everyone from Bella Hadid and Jourdan Dunn to Sophie Turner and Emily Ratajkowski, the label's now-iconic black asymmetric mini dress was among The Lyst Index’s ten hottest women’s products in Q1 this year, and it gained on average over 7,000 searches per month for the remainder of the year. By Charlie Teather This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Once a beloved name amongst industry insiders, Christopher John Rogers has quickly become a mainstream fashion powerhouse, thanks in no small part to his ever-growing list of celebrity fans such as Lady Gaga, Michaela Coel, Bella Hadid and Karlie Kloss. Having secured a collaboration with Target, a cameo in the Gossip Girl reboot caused searches for the brand to jump 73% in July. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. With a strong social media presence, 'It' girl following, and Y2K-inspired TikTok-approved designs, I.AM.GIA is unsurprisingly a hit amongst the Gen-Z set. Best-known for its epic trouser offering, its Halo Pants with pelvic cutouts are clear front-runners - jumping 164% in searches since the start of the year. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Known - and adored - for its gender fluid approach to fashion, Harris Reed's eponymous label first broke onto the scene thanks to a certain Harry Styles. Searches for the designer grew by 189% at the start of the year following the release of Styles’ Vogue December 2020 cover wearing one of Reed’s pieces. Over the next twelve months Reed went on to launch a debut fashion collection, win the GQ Breakthrough Designer of the Year Award, collaborate with jewelry brand Missoma and MAC Cosmetics, and pick up a ‘Leaders of Change’ gong at the Fashion Awards in London. It's the most major awards ceremony on the fashion calendar. By Charlie Teather This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. After Michaela Coel opted to wear a design by London College of Fashion graduate, Maximilian, for the BAFTAs red carpet in April, searches for the label increased 49% within the same month. Other celebrity clients include Naomi Campbell, Rihanna, and A$AP Rocky. Casual. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. With celebrity fans including Hailey Bieber and Dua Lipa it's no surprise The Attico is on the rise. Dua even wore the label's zebra-print bikini in her music video for ‘Love Again’, which resulted in a 224% jump in page views upon its release in June. The swimwear style was among the world’s hottest pieces in Q2 of 2021 and demand for the brand has increased 65% since the start of the year. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The Australian designer has been around for over a decade, but his party-ready pieces and midriff flossing accents are super Instagrammable and align perfectly with 2021's aesthetic mood. Searches for the brand grew 54% year-on year, while searches for the brand’s dresses alone jumped 49% compared to last year. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A UK-based label focussing on sustainability, slow fashion and genderless pieces, Story Mfg. dropped a cruelty-free sneaker in collaboration with Reebok at the start of the year which saw searches for the brand catapult 123% during the first quarter of the year alone. By Charlie Teather This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Marc Jacobs launched his nostalgia-heavy fashion line ‘Heaven’ in September 2020 in a bid to attract the younger, TikTokking, Gen Z customer. So far, of course, its working, with the coveted designs and collaborations (with the likes of Dr. Martens, Cactus Plant Flea Market, Stray Rats and Nodaleto) attracting young, super chic celebrity fans Olivia Rodrigo, Bella Hadid, Beabadoobee and Dua Lipa. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Kim Kardashian certainly knows a thing or two about launching a successful business. Her 'shapewear solutions' line, SKIMS, dressed the US Olympics team’s female athletes during off-duty hours, which subsequently saw the label spike in search by 112% in less than 48 hours. Of course, then came the Fendi x SKIMS collab in late October, which ignited an increase of 233% searches for the brand in just a few hours. Skims x Fendi , take all of our money!

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. We don’t mean to get too excited, but OMG summer is almost here OMG. Warm weather, long, sunny days and more and more people getting vaccinated mean that we’re in the market for a wardrobe refresh. (We can’t just re-wear our summer 2018 fits for friends we haven’t seen in a year, you know?) If you’re like us and are itching to get into some seasonal silhouettes and colors, we suggest trying any of these eight summer fashion trends, from bubblegum pink to Dad pants. RELATED: The 16 Most Comfortable Walking Sandals for Long Strolls in the Park The debate over skinny jeans rages on, and while some millennials insist on clinging to their, well, clingy denim, many others are embracing the Gen Z-approved looser styles like mom jeans, dad jeans and wide-leg or flared silhouettes. Want proof? Google searches for baggy jeans, straight leg jeans and wide leg jeans are all up exponentially from last year, signaling that more and more people are interested in giving their legs a little more breathing room. (In case you’re unsure of how to wear looser denim, here are some outfit suggestions.) Get the look: Articles of Society ($79); Pilcro ($128); AGOLDE ($188) We know, we know: Color for summer? Groundbreaking. But this isn’t just any color, it’s a Malibu Barbie pink that’s guaranteed to put you in an amazing mood. Seen on the Spring/Summer 2021 runways at Chanel, Valentino, Roksanda and more, it’s high fashion-approved but also totally wearable. Go full-on with a shocking pink shirt over short shorts, or add touches via your handbag or even earrings. Get the look: Uncommon Matters earrings ($175); Frank & Eileen button-up ($218); Staud maxi dress ($325) If you’ve seen a TikTok haul or try-on video in the last few months, you know that corset tops are everywhere right now, and for good reason. This lingerie-inspired trend (perhaps Bridgerton inspired) is surprisingly wearable, with a silhouette that sucks you in in all the right places, and looks the coolest when paired with unexpected, decidedly un-bedroom-like pieces, like loose-fitting trousers or high-waist denim. Get the look: Superdown ($48); Bardot ($79); Miaou ($225) Call it the Christopher John Rogers effect. The Louisiana-born, Brooklyn-based designer has been on the rise for a few years now is best known for bold colors, dramatic shapes and, yes, monochromatic silhouettes, which he told NPR are inspired by going to church with his grandmother as a kid. Whether you pair white jeans (loose, of course) with an oversize white button-down or match your maxi dress to your belt (and bag, and sunglasses), wearing all one color is an easy way to tell the world you know what you’re doing, fashion-wise. Get the look: Zelie for She dress ($139): Dagne Dover bag ($325); Butaby sunglasses ($13) No, this isn’t your average 2010 body-con club dress with giant holes in the sides. Summer 2021’s cut-outs are entirely grown-up and consummately stylish. On Spring/Summer 2021 runways at Chloe and Proenza Schouler, cutouts were spotted on collarbones, ribcages, upper backs and more. That means you can go as big—or small—as you want with this trend. Just make sure to apply sunscreen judiciously. Get the look: Avec les Filles midi dress ($99); Porridge romper ($168); Sandro midi dress ($395) Searches for the ‘70s shoe on the global shopping platform Lyst are up more than 125 percent from this time last year, with wooden soles being the most coveted styles. And we have to agree that after almost 14 months of wearing slippers around the house and sneakers to the grocery store, a low heel is an excellent way to ease the transition back into society. These babies are incredibly comfortable, easy to walk in and surprisingly versatile. Wear yours with a fitted tank and floaty midi skirt or your favorite jeans and T-shirt. Get the look: Madewell ($168); Swedish Hasbeens ($250); Rachel Comey ($450) Maxi dresses are a summer staple, but we’re particularly into this year’s most popular iteration: Gauzy, floor-grazing frocks that make us want to twirl. Think: Emerald Fennell’s Gucci Oscars dress or Maya Rudolph’s Valentino Golden Globes dress. To counter the ethereal vibes, pair yours with sneakers and casual accessories, like a baseball cap (instead of a floppy hat) and a funky tote bag (instead of a fancy clutch). Get the look: SWF ($175); Maeve ($178); Farm Rio ($228) After more than a year of wearing sweats and T-shirts, many of us are on the hunt for items that bridge the gap between slouchy sweatpants and more constricting, dressed-up slacks. The answer just may be Dad pants, which are trousers that are pleated at the waist with a looser fit through the leg, for a look that’s a little Danny Tanner and a little Gigi Hadid. Searches for the semi-tailored trouser are up 67 percent according to the global shopping platform ShopStyle. So go ahead and alert Pops: He’s officially cool again. Get the look: Everlane ($88); Mara Hoffman ($325); Lafayette 148 New York ($448) RELATED: How Eco-Friendly Is Sustainable Denim, Really?

,These Are The '80s Fashion Trends Stylists Say Will Be Everywhere in 2022,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/80s-fashion,,,,,,"It's no secret fashion trends from the 1990s and early 2000s are having a moment like never before, but the alternative era isn't the only time period pushing for a renaissance. Amidst all the mom jeans and exaggerated flares, skort outfits, printed denim, and black dress pants, fashionistas are also making room in their wardrobes for iconic '80s fashion. Naturally, we're on the edge of our seats (re: glued to our phones) waiting to see which totally rad throwback threads fully come back around. RELATED: 1980s Preppy Heathers Style Has Returned Part of the draw when it came to the return of '90s and early aughts clothing is that these trends all played into nostalgia. With our own fond memories of bucket hats and, um, butt fashion, we simply couldn't resist — and, naturally, the 1980s offers more of the same. Even if you didn't get a chance to live out the decade in real-time, you'll definitely want to get in on round two. Key elements of '80s fashion include color, playfulness, and comfort — all the things we're loving at the moment. Just think about it: the '80s brought us fishnets and legwarmers, served up electric colorways and the naked dress, made a case for leggings-as-pants, and inserted shoulder pads into any blazer and blouse that designers would allow. Plus, it wasn't just the clothing that became historic: the women who made these looks their own are the same ones we draw inspiration from today. The '80s gave us Princess Diana's revenge dress and signature turtlenecks-under-sweaters moments, as well as Madonna's corsets and tulle and layered jewelry. Demi Moore and Molly Ringwald challenging gendered dressing norms, while Lisa Bonet advertising a cool, eclectic style. If you dig deep enough, there's an '80s aesthetic for every style preference. And while we'd absolutely advise looking to the archived celebrity looks of the time for inspiration, we also went ahead and reached out to a few fashion experts, getting their opinion on which '80s trends we'll especially be seeing more of in the next few months — and, most importantly, how to wear these looks in 2022. RELATED: Whitney Houston's '80s Outfits Were Full of Timeless Fashion Lessons The '80s was a vibrant and glamorous decade, especially within the music industry. To fully recreate that iconic glam-rock aesthetic, Tobi head stylist Joanna Angeles says platform shoes, metallic staples, leather fabrics, and lots of glittery accents are key. ""To take it to the next level, incorporate lace, statement belts, gloves, power suits, and oversized boxy blazers,"" Angeles tells InStyle. ""Forget less is more — with the '80s, more is definitely more, and making a statement is always the way to go."" For girls night out or happy hour (or just because), Angeles says the '80s trend she'd gravitate towards would be a mini skirt decked out in sequins. ""Pair with bold colored pointed toe pumps, a tucked-in, flowy white button-up, and chunky gold jewelry for an extra touch of glam."" In an exclusive interview with InStyle, co-founder of JLUX, Christina Jaide revealed her number favorite style from the '80s to wear today is an oversized blazer with big shoulders. ""They're too good to move on from,"" Jaide declares over email. ""If you are reaching for something oversized and you are sporting a smaller frame, give the look a try with a defined waistline. Adding a belt will ensure your shape is at the forefront of your look!"" RELATED: Tapered Puff Sleeves Are the Easy, Romantic Fashion Trend That Will Make You Feel Like Royalty Teresa Jaide, the other half of JLUX, says a bodysuit is a fashion trend from the '80s that's appropriate for any occasion, especially when worn as a sleek foundation piece. ""I would recommend going from a top to a bodysuit when sporting a look where you don't want to bulge while tucking it in — such as a classic button-down — or when you're baring your shoulders,"" she tells us. ""Having the extra support ensures your look stays intact. Try pairing your bodysuit with wide-leg trousers or even a flowy skirt. The tightness of the bodysuit will help balance out your look.""","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us These Are The '80s Fashion Trends Stylists Say Will Be Everywhere in 2022 Glam Rocker Sequins Oversized Blazers with Shoulder Pads Bodysuits Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

,Rom-com dressing is the spring/summer 21 micro-trend that’s arrived just in time for valentine’s day,,https://www.vogue.in/fashion/gallery/rom-com-dressing-is-the-springsummer-21-micro-trend-thats-arrived-just-in-time-for-valentine-day,Naomi Pike,https://assets.vogue.in/photos/6020e218110c3c0cec1092be/1:1/w_1600%2Cc_limit/MissVromcom.jpg,,8 February 2021,,"Follow us By Naomi Pike Just like a well-dressed protagonist in a teen movie, you’re going to fall hard for this one With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, it’s time you leaned into a more romantic style of dressing–whether you have date night plans for 14 February or not. Conveniently, a micro-trend emerging from the spring/summer 2021 shows fits the bill perfectly. We’re calling it rom-com dressing. And just like a well-dressed protagonist in a movie, you’re going to fall hard for this one. Rom-com dressing takes the best parts of the resurgence of all-things Noughties and pairs it with the sweet colour palette we associate with a character on the brink of falling in love… and then out of love, before a soppy reunion leads to a happily ever after as the credits roll. It’s Jenna (Jennifer Garner) in 13 Going On 30; Eva (Gabrielle Union) in Deliver Us From Eva; and Cameron Diaz, Selma Blair and Christina Applegate in The Sweetest Thing, all crossed with Hilary Duff as Lizzie McGuire and everything worn by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen before they turned 18 – and served up with a side order of Regina George sass. Overall, the look is considered, well-accessorised and put together with personality. Frills, feathers, and flounces are plentiful, as are clashing prints, ab flashes and sweet strappy sandals. There’s also the well-played out styling trick of a brilliant ballgown paired with chunky boots to hint at a character’s anarchic streak, as seen in Alexander McQueen’s part-punk, part-pink collection. Ever the early adoptor, Kendall Jenner has already fallen for this micro-trend. The model quickly pulled a Blumarine catwalk look, wearing the Italian brand’s leopard-print satin trousers with sweet lemon layers on Christmas Day. Blumarine led the charge on rom-com dressing at the shows, and the collection is essential viewing for anyone ready to dress for the movie of their life. Kendall Jenner wears Blumarine. Elsewhere, Givenchy’s layering was straight out of the rom-com wardrobe, just given a more seditious spin. Chloé gave us the kooky cool-girl take, pairing a cute print mini with a clashing printed T-shirt. Miu Miu, Charlotte Knowles and Ashley Williams all delivered their own retro approach, while at Paco Rabanne, the ultimate 2021 take on the perfect date-night dress was worn by Ashley Radjarame for the Paris Fashion Week presentation. An upgrade on TikTok’s obsession with main-character dressing, this little trend is just the thing to boost your mood right now. Here, 20 looks from the spring/summer 2021 collections to inspire you to live out your own Noughties rom com this season.

,You Can Easily Recreate This Spring '22 Trend Using the Clothes in Your Closet,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/colorblocking-trend-spring-2022,,,,,,"For fashion-lovers, half the fun of a runway show is planning ahead. Which pieces will we be adding to our shopping lists in the future? What are next season's hottest trends? And, more importantly, which ones can we start wearing now, before the rest of the world catches on? For spring 2022, the answer to that question is colorblocking — which isn't exactly a new concept, but rather a look that always feels fresh and exciting. This time around, vibrant, saturated color combos have popped up in designer collections from New York, London, and Milan, both through two-toned pieces and specific styling choices. RELATED: Pick a Favorite Shoulder, Because Asymmetrical Styles Are Everywhere for Spring '22 The good news is colorblocking is a trend we all can try now, even though spring 2022 feels far away. Check out the designers putting a new spin on this standout look, then see how you can pull it off with your own wardrobe — for $0! Two colors that unexpectedly look great together? Pink and red. PatBO embraced the two-toned trend for Spring '22 by including this sexy cutout design in its collection. Blink and you might miss this subtle pink and red combo from Proenza Schouler's spring runway. Although the colorblocking detail may be small, it still packs a pretty sweet punch upon closer inspection. Matching sets may be a low-effort, pre-made look, but the mix of French blue and Gen Z green in this spring '22 option gives things a more fashion-forward twist. RELATED: Sorry, Sweatsuits — You've Just Been Replaced By The 3-Piece Outfit Trend Okay, okay, we got the memo — two-toned, cutout dresses are for sure going to the top of our spring shopping list. RELATED: Hole-Punched Pants Are Happening Some designers, such as Prabal Gurung, showcased the colorblocking trend through styling. Combining two bright colors, like a teal shirt with an orange suit, is an easy way to give it a try on your own. Christian Siriano also convinced us to think beyond neutrals with our accessories. A colorful dress manages to pop even more with the addition of an equally bright but contrasting bag and pair of earrings. RELATED: Amelia Hamlin Is Excited to Break Out Fall's Most Classic Yet Underrated Accessory When layering a sweater or shrug over your dress, pick one in a contrasting color, allowing you to shake things up in a simple way. We're partial to wearing pink with green, just like Brandon Maxwell did for spring '22. When colorblocking, you don't have to stick with solid pieces. Coach tried this trick while incorporating plaid — a versatile print that works year-round! RELATED: 12 Plaid Outfit Ideas to Try This Fall Kick things off by combining just two colors, like pairing a purple jacket with an orange bag. Usually, we'll try to balance out a bold outfit by working in some neutral items, like a black blazer or white shoes. But, if you really want to nail the colorblocking trend, go with something pink, green, blue, or other bright shades instead. One way to tie this mismatched outfit together is with repetition. If you're mixing three colors through your jacket, skirt, and shoes, choose one or two of those same colors when picking out a purse, earrings, or other accessory to go with your look.","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us You Can Easily Recreate Spring 2022's Colorblocking Trend Using the Clothes in Your Closet PatBO Proenza Schouler Anna Sui David Koma Prabal Gurung Christian Siriano Brandon Maxwell Coach How to Colorblock: Start Simple How to Colorblock: Make Small Swaps How to Colorblock: Create a Scheme Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

,Fashion's Biggest Spring Trend Is Also Its Most Literal,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/egg-fashion-trend,,,,,,"Everyone responds differently to stress, and after a year of shared tumult some unpredictable outcomes have included: influencers raising chickens, and an egg salad sandwich T-shirt selling like hotcakes. Designers, from Edie Parker to Bottega Veneta are selling egg-shaped clothing in egg-inspired colors (the latter makes shoes in a shade named Egg Yolk). Others have actual egg motifs. This, in a year when many of us have, let's say, lowered the bar on home cooking and come to rely on the humble egg for our daily protein. Spring is officially here, and it's beginning to look like the season's biggest fashion trend is also quite possibly its most literal: eggs. They're suddenly everywhere. The egg obsession is something that we've been working up to. At one point in 2019, the most liked photo on instagram was a random egg. The pandemic has only amplified the egg's power, imbuing it with unexpected meaning. After more than a year of being cooped up, overwhelmed, out of sorts, we can see something of a fresh start - rebirth - in the symbolism of the egg that feels all too necessary as many begin to plot their escape into plein air. For those stepping an uneasy foot out of the house for the first time, there's comfort in eggs' soft, soothing color palette; their shape without a single hard edge. ""What better perfect totem for this new year of brand new beginnings and hope?"" We just can't escape the egg. Even the queen of downtown cool and purveyor of quirky beaded bags you can't scroll through Instagram without seeing is in on it. Susan Alexandra created a bag with a big, yolky pearlized egg just like the kind you'd find in your steaming hot bodega sandwich (available in hair clip form, too). In a bright shade of sky blue with its near-neon yolk, the bag is a playful piece with a much deeper meaning. ""I infuse all of my pieces with symbolism, and eggs represent rebirth and new beginnings,"" explains Alexandra. ""What better perfect totem for this new year of brand new beginnings and hope? The egg is such a charming and visually appealing symbol - at once irreverent and nostalgic."" And when we said ""literal"" we meant it: This line is made in collaboration with the country's leading ethical and sustainable producer of actual eggs, Handsome Brook Farms. Shoppers can get cartons of farm-fresh eggs with their egg bag and barrette, plus donate eggs to NYC community fridges. As for high fashion, there are almost too many eggs on the runway to put in our basket. For Loewe Spring 2021, designer Jonathan Anderson rendered voluminous pieces - heavily puffed, rounded sleeves, and cocoon-like skirts that resembled a hard-boiled egg ready to be plopped into a lunchbox. Louis Vuitton, too, had blobby coats and jackets for spring 2021 like an egg running on the plate, and a few seasons earlier released a perfectly shaped egg bag, dubbed the LV Egg Case. Rising designer Caroline Hu's spring 2021 collection was done entirely in eggshell white, and one dress in particular resembles the bulbous silhouette of the egg white you might find in your salad, along with the textural sentiment of its broken, jagged shell. (A bit feathered and fluffy feeling, too, it's almost a 'chicken or the egg' riddle rendered in fabric.) Prada's Spring 2021 coats - in a color that can only be described as hardboiled yolk - hang over the wearer like a protective shell. Comme des Garcons and JW Andersons' fall 2021 collections also showed very round, cocoon-like wearable egg concoctions (the former of which had egg-white like films of fabric and the latter resembling a soft boiled egg smashed open for a lazy Sunday morning). And there's been absolutely no shortage of buttery-hued egg accessories out there, like Edie Parker's cracked egg clutch and tray. We can also thank Simone Rocha for the trend. A few seasons ago, Rocha began producing elegant egg-shaped handbags in marbled pink, black leather and pearlescent white, and for spring 2021 she introduced pearl chains, gem-encrusted handles and beaded straps (shown in the collage above). ""I designed the pearl egg as I wanted to take something so historically classic but create something refined and playful,"" says Rocha. ""Playing with the proportion, so that it could hold and cradle your belongings."" Like a real egg, the silhouette serves as a warm, fragile, and feminine protection for what's inside. ""I have always been drawn to the egg shape as a symbol of life, fertility, and purity."" One of fashion's favorite jewelers, Sophie Buhai has been selling egg pendants since 2015, and in 2021, considers them a true signature of the brand. ""I have always been drawn to the egg shape as a symbol of life, fertility, and purity,"" she says. ""Some of my favorite artists have interpreted the egg in their own ways, including [bronze artist Constantin] Brancusi and Man Ray. I love the surrealist quality of the silver egg around a woman's neck. It's a powerful symbol to adorn oneself with."" She also offers them in gold. The fashion egg can be traced back hundreds of years, and it's near impossible to forget the OG: Fabergé, the Russian jewelry brand founded in 1842 that continues to make all things egg-luxury. Tracing back to the brand's beginnings, the reason for exploring eggs in finery were similar to what's making them popular today: an ode to femininity and organic beauty. ""Mainly because it is a perfect design, courtesy of mother nature, we make very simple gold egg pendants without any further embellishment to emphasize its natural beauty,"" says Josina von dem Bussche-Kessell, Fabergé Global Sales Director. ""We make Fabergé eggs in all colours and sizes but only in the one shape, as we believe we can't outdo the perfection of nature."" This year, the jewelry brand even collaborated with Game of Thrones for the show's 10th anniversary. The result? A $2.2 million 18-karat white gold egg with diamond panes and rainbow moonstones that feels very dragon-chic. If this proves anything it's that 2021 is the year of the egg. Today's egg trend plays up the natural elements, going beyond form to celebrate the many soothing hues eggs spill forth, from creamy whites to farmer's market browns. And manicurists have already declared yellow the color of the season for summer 2021. If you have yolky fingertips in your future, it won't be hard to complete the look. Fendi, Gucci and Chloe swept shades of egg-farm friendly neutrals throughout their Spring 2021 collections. Fendi gave us well-cooked omelette dresses, shown above next to a robin's egg shade. Gucci served up Eggbeaters from a carton straight onto a pair of tights (below) and bags. Meanwhile, Chloë kept things cool in dresses the color of a light poach. And internet-beloved brands Khaite and Nanushka, which were already well-known for elevated casual clothing in calming colors, amped up their ovo-inspired offerings in spring 2021: Khaite with more hardboiled-egg shaped sleeves and fresh, eggshell-white shades; Nanushka with a color palette that bordered on the more organic side of things - slightly yellowed, soft browns. Designer Simon Jacquemus has, for the past few seasons, rendered crop tops, structured pants, and summer dresses in the softest shades of organic brown, buttery yellow and shirred egg off-white. On the brand's website right now, a lookbook features a model alighting in a field, who very well could be on the hunt for free-range eggs. For Spring 2021, the brand's overcooked yolk skirts and trousers took a front seat, bringing other barely there yellows and whites along for the ride. A white gown with a rounded bottom looks like the perfect boiled egg perched on its cup. In 2021, fashion has been manifesting comfort, that's for sure. Plenty of people have swapped jeans for sweats or cute stretchy pants without looking back. Now that many are experiencing their first tastes of leaving home (and dressing accordingly), fashion has found a new way to bring comfort along: oddly enough, it's in the form of a comfort food.","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us Fashion's Biggest Spring Trend Is Also Its Most Literal Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

,8 Major Summer Fashion Trends That Are Already in Your Closet,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/best-summer-2021-fashion-trends-in-your-closet,,,,,,"The great thing about living in the age of online shopping and Amazon Prime memberships is that pretty much anything you'd ever want to buy is just a few clicks away. When it comes to clothing, that's especially true. We've fallen down plenty of holes lately, searching for the perfect wedding guest look or trying to find latest item going viral on TikTok. But, what if we told you the absolute best fashion trends for summer 2021 are actually free-99? Well, it's true - because there's a good chance many, if not all, are already sitting in your closet. RELATED: This Fashion Trick Is the Easiest Way to Give Old Clothes a Whole New Look You've probably heard by now that throwback looks are resurfacing, and on top of that, seasonless fashion is on the rise. Classics are reigning supreme, and the spicer, more statement-making styles can easily be DIY'd or replicated with a few quick tricks. Take a look at what's worth re-wearing for the season ahead, and if you're still stumped on how to style these items for modern day? We've got plenty of summer outfit ideas to inspire you, too. RELATED: Someone Alert Christina Aguilera, Because Twisted Halter-Neck Tops Are Trending We'll always have a soft spot in our hearts for midis and maxis, but with the return of sexy '00s fashion, we're loving this leggy look that works for just about any occasion. How to Wear Mini Skirts For Summer 2021: Make your mini feel more understated with an oversized shirt and 'ugly' sandals, or go full Y2K with a crocheted halter neck or crop top - and don't forget your baguette bag and claw clip! Puff sleeves refuse to leave our rotation, yet somehow, they're always whimsical and fun instead of stale and boring. It's possible you've already stocked up on voluminous blanket dresses in 2020, so feel free to break them out once again. How to Wear Puff Sleeves For Summer 2021: We're feeling fashion's bold, chaotic vibe as of late, and while big-sleeved tops and dresses can turn heads all on their own, feel free to get even more OTT. Add a pair of statement earrings, opt for lace-up sandals, or even reach for bow details to turn it full cottagecore. RELATED: Fairycore Fashion is the Dreamy, Ethereal Trend You Have to Try Skin is especially in for 2021, and if you don't already own backless designs or something with cutouts (another major trend that's bubbling up), you can go the belly-baring route - even if it means cutting or knotting an old tee. How to Wear Crop Tops For Summer 2021: Use this one to balance out bottoms that offer more coverage, such as Bermudas, bike shorts, and baggy jeans or trousers on a chilly day. Playing around with different proportions or fit (loose vs. tight) will create an outfit that's interesting to look at. It's time to go full '00s popstar and play around with string details. If you own a dress that ties at the shoulder, skip the neat bows and crisscross your straps or tie them to one side instead. TikTok has even shown us that even a basic cami can be transformed into anything from a strappy halterneck to a skirt, and that there are also ways to play around with shoelaces to create a handful of looks. Plus, you're not imagining things - the peek-a-boo thong is also having a moment. How to Wear Straps and Strings For Summer 2021: Of course, this trend - especially if you're DIYing it - is all about experimentation, but you really want it to be the focus of your ensemble. Don't pair these pieces anything too loud in order to let your strappy something shine. RELATED: If Low-Rise Makes You Cringe, You'll Really Hate Thong Jeans Another piece that can be turned into something brand new for #ShotGirlSummer? A scarf. Fasten it around your neck to add flair to your outfit, use it as a hair accessory, or (if it's long enough, or can be tucked into a bralette) wrap it around your body and style it as a top. How to Wear Scarves For Summer 2021: Grab a chain necklace and knot the scarf in the center before securing it around your neck. Then, grab the two sides of the the scarf, bring down and around your chest area, and tie it in back. It should now look like the above top, while making use of old pieces sitting in your drawer. Despite the fact that boots are typically considered a fall and winter staple, warm weather styles are becoming pretty popular. Even model Irina Shayk is a fan of the summer boot, and included one in her collaboration with Tamara Mellon. How to Wear Boots For Summer 2021: Use this shoe as a way to make fancy summer staples, like sundresses, into an outfit that's more relaxed. You can even wear your favorite knee-high pair with the aforementioned mini skirt, providing a bit of balance. Chances are you own fair share of button-downs, which is good news, since baggy shirts and tees are once again a key part of the summer rotation. They're essentially the perfect throw-on-and-go piece: they can be worn with just about any bottom, work as a swimsuit coverup, and even be layered like a light sweater. How to Wear Oversized Shirts For Summer 2021: Wear your button-down with Bermuda shorts and slides for a full relaxed look, or use one to replace your go-to jacket, styling it over a crop top or sundress when things get chilly. RELATED: Classic Button-Downs Are a Wardrobe Essential That Looks Good On Everyone After a multiple-year run, it seems as if those teeny tiny, '90s-inspired sunglasses are on their way out, being replaced with glamorous, oversized options once again. Go ahead and dig them out of your collection to enjoy some full coverage this season. How to Wear Large Sunglasses For Summer 2021: Try your hand at the '70s trend and style these babies with flares, crochet, and fringe. You can also wear your oversized shades with basics, using them as the statement piece in an otherwise simple outfit.","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us 8 Major Summer Fashion Trends That Are Already in Your Closet Mini Skirts Puff Sleeves Crop Tops Straps and Strings Scarves Boots Oversized Shirts Large Sunglasses Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

,Top 10 Future Of Fashion Trends Reshaping The Industry (In 2022),,https://thevou.com/fashion/future-of-fashion/,Bruce Knox,https://thevou.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/WTVOX-future-of-fashion.jpg,,22 November 2021,https://thevou.com/author/techwise/,"The future of fashion has a new meaning now, with the advancement of artificial intelligence and NFTs. Even before the COVID pandemic, the world was getting closer to a point of physical and digital convergence. We already have smart clothing that allows us to perform better and interact with the surrounding environment. Smart clothes that change shape and color according to the type of activity you’re about to embark on.  Clothes that can initiate a safe and eco-friendly decomposing procedure, at the end of their programmed life, only to be reused to create new textiles. And, with the boom of Metaverse and the NFT universe, there are digital garments and layers of software projected in AR environments. Without further ado, these are the top 10 trends reshaping the future of fashion, right now.   Not a new concept, Ryan Jasin’s fashion creations ‘grow’ at the same time with the wearer, up to seven sizes. Inspired by the Japanese Origami and called adaptive clothing, Ryan is a winner of the prestigious James Dyson UK award. The designer’s creations consist of lightweight pleated fabric patterned to make the garments ‘play proof’, machine-washable, and most important, fully recyclable.   Creations of Angela Luna, a Parsons School of Design graduate, these shape-changing garments can also be used as a shelter. The original idea was inspired by refugees and their inability to carry around belongings or have a shelter while traveling thousands of miles. The concept of garments with ‘modular shape and adaptive functionality’ has begun to gain traction. It is an approach that fits the current eco-fashion narrative driven by sustainable clothing labels seeking to minimize manufacturing waste.   The textile fiber from orange peel keeps gaining increased adoption and use amongst fashion designers from all over the world. The material was popularised amongst luxury fashion buyers by Salvatore Ferragamo, through a dedicated capsule collection of t-shirts and scarves. The next line aims to have a natural scent infusion, which changes according to the time of the day and the wearer’s mood.   Following a collection made from Algae plants, that has reached the finalists of the 2018 H&M Global Innovation Awards, the skin-feeding clothes business shows there’s massive potential. One example is a German design studio, Blond & Bieber who’s using microalgae as a sustainable fabric dye. The collection was made from Algae-based biodegradable fibers and eco-friendly dyes and was prised for its capability of releasing nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, onto the wearer’s body.   Yves Béhar, the founder of ‘FuseProject’, came up with an original idea of power-garments. Initially, Yves wanted to allow people suffering from muscle dystrophia to function normally. That is, being able to walk, stand, and be active again for extended periods of time, while also looking good. Béhar’s concept found a lot of traction in the medical landscape. However, there’s a new wave of innovative fashion designers showing a growing interest in augmenting the human body with cyborg-like abilities.   A similar smart fashion prototype, pictured above in the shape of a cardigan, was ignited by the Dutch designer Pauline van Dongen. Following in the footsteps of Ivan Poupyrev’s Project Jacquard at Google, Pauline has embedded her ‘Vigour Cardigan’ with flexible sensors. Made out of conductive yarns, these sensors collect and analyze the wearer’s biometrics, aiming to identify the most efficient exercises and body postures. Hopefully, future connected garments will ensure – through a direct-line connection with your personal doctor or assistive medical data software – that the paramedics are at your door, long before you start having stroke symptoms.   Recent waves of innovations targeting the fashion industry have led to an influx of tech-based designers seeking to showcase a new world of techniques, materials, manufacturing methods, and creations. 3D printing has become one of the most popular ‘tools’ used by emerging fashion designers. Iris Van Herpen is the incontestable leader of the movement, thanks to her amazing work at the edge of innovation, and creations out of this world. The latest developments in 3D printing see a shift towards bio and eco-friendly inks, which could be the beginning of a new era of 3D printed sustainable clothes, for a cleaner industry and a better world.   So far it has been impossible to eradicate the use of leather and fur in fashion by using leather alternatives, such as mushroom leather or kelp leather. Leather is deeply embedded in our DNA as a symbol of status since the times of living in caves and wearing our catches as trophies. Then, ‘thanks’ to the luxury segment, by creating this high quality-leather association in consumers’ minds. However, the use of leather in fashion is tainted not only by the blood of the animals killed for their skins but also by the significant emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic chemicals involved in mass farming animals, tanning, and industrial manufacturing processes. Finally, there are innovative brands such as Modern Meadow, Bolt Threads, and Furoid TM, creating lab-grown leather, allowing fashion startups to create faster and easier vegan clothing and accessories.   Initially, the use of augmented reality in fashion has found a lot of traction in the retail side of the landscape. Gucci’s demo version of a shop for luxury garments remains one of the best examples. Styled as a dark garden filled with diamonds, attractive models, and pictures on the walls, the platform was designed to showcase the power of experiential e-commerce. A similar AR experience project was launched by Zara across 120 stores. The project allowed buyers to hold up their smartphones to the stores’ windows and see AR models come to life, walking around, and wearing the latest fashion trends. However, while it seems that the adoption of AR in fashion retail is not quite there, the concept of AR has a big role to play in the future of fashion. SIMILAR ARTICLES Top 22 Technologies Shaping The Fashion Industry What Is Fashion Technology? Expert Definition And Examples Is There Any Future For VR In Fashion?  In fact, driven by the endeavors of Mathew Drinkwater, Head of Fashion Innovation Agency at London College of Fashion, a new realm of augmented reality garments gains traction fast. In some ways, it makes a lot of sense as the whole point of fashion in general and luxury fashion, in particular, is to make shoppers dream. The elusive aspirations of unique attires, ceremonious runway shows, photoshopped models in glossy magazines, all meant to design an unattainable world compared to the one they live in. For that, AR has the most fitting in the world of fashion, especially now when we are becoming increasingly ‘digitized’. AR garments have the potential of pushing the boundaries of what we understand fashion to be, by re-computing the nature of who we are and by affecting one’s idea of the self. AR couture could also give birth to a new concept of self-identity that could bridge the gap between the actual and ideal selves. However, with unknown and potentially disastrous consequences for both, the self and fashion industry as we know it.   There can’t be an article about the future of fashion, without tackling the emergence of AI. The use of AI in the fashion industry has already found a home in customer service, demand forecasting, planning, buying, operations automation, supply chain, inventory management. More recently, we see AI taking over trend spotting, product design, and high-level customization. However, YOOX’s latest endeavor – 8 an AI-designed fashion label – is beyond the traditional areas of machine tasks. AI as a fashion designer is a new role that touches the creative realm, blurring the line between technology, human, and creativity.   The first question that comes to mind is, will consumers prefer AI-made or human-made fashion? Traditionally, a human-made garment encapsulates craftsmanship, heritage, and history. It comprises the experiences, memories, life choices, and even the emotions of its creator. However, in the case of an omnipotent and salient AI, the ‘designer’ has access to the history of the entire humanity.   It can draw inspiration from humanity’s history, from our ‘evolutionary struggles’, as depicted in science, to music and art. It has access to all materials in the world, able to compare and select the most suitable elements for its intended creations. It can also decide on the most efficient manufacturing technologies… And, to complicate things a bit further, who owns the rights of its, his, or her creations? This takes me to the question, is personhood the next step for AI? Celebrities, designers, and latest news in sustainable fashion.  Which one of these trends signaling the future of fashion is your favorite and why? Are there any other trends and innovations shaping the future of fashion that you’re aware of and want to add to this list? Comments below, please!

,Meet the 10 breakout models of Spring 2022,,https://www.vogue.in/fashion/gallery/meet-the-10-breakout-models-of-spring-2022,Janelle Okwodu,https://assets.vogue.in/photos/61727e878b7f5b733c9afa6e/1:1/w_1600%2Cc_limit/100_story.jpg,,31 October 2021,,"Follow us By Janelle Okwodu The most notable models of the season were also artists, aspiring doctors, theater geeks, and stylish students After a year of virtual shows and lookbooks, fashion month returned to form with the spring 2022 collections. The return of real world events and international travel allowed new models to make their mark on the runways of New York, London, Milan, and Paris, and contribute to the renewed optimism and sense of possibility that defined the season. Runway models tended to be anonymous in the early aughts, but modern casting is all about personality. Whether they share a moniker with one of music’s biggest stars, have a name that calls to mind royalty, or happen to be the year’s breakout star, the most notable models of the season were exceptional. Artists, aspiring doctors, theater geeks, or stylish surfers, they’re all well worth remembering. Below, a guide to the ten new models who enlivened the season’s collections. Age: 24 Agency: Supreme Management Hometown: Caracas, Venezuela Season Highlights: Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Loewe, Prada If América Gonzalez hadn’t listened to her sister, the Venezuelan rising star never would have found her way onto the runway. During Gonzalez’s second year of medical school at the Central University of Venezuela, her sibling heard about an open call in Caracas and pushed her to attend. Gonzalez was immediately scouted, and though she still plans on eventually finishing up her degree and becoming a doctor, she’s currently enjoying plenty of success in fashion. This season, she booked one top show after another and became a favorite amongst street style photographers. Age: 19 Agency: The Lions Hometown: Osbourn, Antigua and Barbuda Season Highlights: Valentino, Marni, AZ Factory, Proenza Schouler Given the performer that 19-year-old Antiguan newcomer Beyoncé Ambrose is named after, she was destined to do big things. The daughter of Sir Curtly Ambrose, an Cricket icon, Beyoncé could have followed her father’s footsteps into sports, but her passions lie in performance—in fashion and beyond. A theater major at Georgia State University and a YouTube personality, Ambrose excels in front of the camera. At shows like Valentino, Lanvin, and Proenza Schouler, she showed the world that there’s more than one Beyoncé worth paying attention to. Age: 19 Agency: DNA Models Hometown: Miami Beach, Florida Season Highlights: Gabriela Hearst, Brandon Maxwell, Altuzarra, Chloé When it comes to size inclusivity, fashion talks a big game, but rarely allows models who aren’t a sample size to have their moment in the limelight. Still, one of the bright spots of spring 2022 was the emergence of Devyn Garcia, a Floridian beauty who made her way into the casts of prestige shows like Altuzarra, Brandon Maxwell, and Chloé. Garcia’s commercial work was already impressive—she counts brands like Victoria’s Secret, and Nordstrom as regular clients—but she introduced herself to a whole new audience during the shows. Thanks to her natural beauty and confident presence, we’re sure to be seeing a lot more of her shortly. Age: 19 Agency: Women Management Hometown: Santiago, Dominican Republic Season Highlights: Versace, Loewe, Acne Studios, Saint Laurent Three years ago, Dominican beauty Lina Cruz took it upon herself to head to a casting in her hometown and was immediately signed by Luis Menieur, the designer-turned agency owner who discovered Vogue favorite Arlenis Sosa. Cruz arrived on the international scene with a stellar debut at Versace’s spring/summer 2022 collection heading onto the runway moments after Dua Lipa. From there, Cruz went on to walk key shows like Saint Laurent, Loewe, Alexander McQueen, and the star-studded tribute to Alber Elbaz at AZ Factory. With her dramatic high cheekbones and graceful strut, the 19-year-old newcomer was a compelling presence on the runway, and her success is poised to carry over into campaign season. Age: 21 Agency: IMG Hometown: San Francisco, California Season Highlights: Balenciaga, Miu Miu From the moment Ella Emhoff emerged as a presence in the fashion industry, she’s brought something unique to the table. Emhoff receives plenty of attention for her style and connection to politics, but as a talented ceramics artist, knitwear designer, and model, she’s fascinating all on her own. A multi-hyphenate who has inspired her artistic peers, she’s impressed creatives like Demna Gvasalia, Miuccia Prada, and Proenza Schouler’s Jack and Lazaro Hernandez. During her first full season, Emhoff walked the collections in Europe, attended the Met Gala in custom Stella McCartney, and was a chic presence in the front row—precisely what a modern model ought to be doing. Age: 21 Agency: The Society Management Hometown: Vienna, Austria Season Highlights: Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, Chloé, Hermes With a Prada campaign and the the cover of Vogue Italia already under her belt, gamine Austrian Greta Hofer began the season at an advantage. After honing her skills with exclusive work with Prada, Hofer proved she could stand her own at shows for prominent designers, so spring/summer 2022 was all about branding out and showcasing her versatility. During the European collections, she did just that, transforming to match the mood of each brand moving from 90s’ style minimalist muse at Jil Sander to leather-clad it-girl for Courreges and prim Parisian at Dior. Age: 26 Agency: Supreme Management Hometown: Bangkok, Thailand Season Highlights: Simone Rocha, Rick Owens, Chanel, Success isn’t an overnight proposition, and Jan Baiboon has spent the last seven years climbing the ranks. While attending a modeling competition in Bangkok, Scouted, she dominated the local market until she had her International crossover moment with an exclusive on Burberry's spring/summer 2020 runway. Since then, Baiboon has undergone a beauty transformation, dyeing her long dark locks a striking shade of ginger and making a splash at some of the season’s biggest shows. Age: 24 Agency: Women Management Hometown: Pasadena, California Season Highlights: Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Lanvin, Givenchy, Dior It’s fitting that one of this season’s runway queens has the most regal name. From the moment Majesty Amare made her debut at Proenza Schouler in a crisp white column gown, she was destined to go places, and it’s easy to see why. With her serene presence, the 24-year-old from Pasadena brought a touch of youthful elegance to every runway she graced, becoming one of the moment’s most in-demand faces in the process. Age: 19 Agency: IMG Hometown: Fairbanks, Alaska Season Highlights: Chanel, Chloé, Prabal Gurung Even if she weren’t adding a touch of American insouciance to Chanel’s runway and closing the proceedings at Gabriela Hearst, Quannah Chasinghorse would be the model of the moment. A singular beauty whose presence in the industry is helping to open doors for other indigenous talents, Chasinghorse has been an essential part of fashion in 2021. Whether she was walking for Rihanna at Savage x Fenty, appearing in the pages of Vogue, or speaking about the importance of representation during a New York Fashion Week panel, she’s used her platform gracefully. Age: 18 Agency: The Society Management Hometown: Nelson, South Island, New Zeland Season Highlights: Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Raf Simons, Prada If you miss the days when modeling was less about social media and more about one-of-a-kind faces, New Zealander Lucy Rosiek should appeal to you. The 18-year-old’s distinctive look caught the attention of casting directors, who were wowed by her dramatic features and throwback vibe. Rosiek was the toast of Europe, front and center at Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Prada, and Christopher Esber, who first worked with her when she was making waves at Sydney Fashion Week this summer.

,These 11 Fashion Trends Are Going Viral This Summer - But They're Actually From the '70s,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/70s-summer-fashion-trends,,,,,,"You've probably heard it about 8 million times: the top clothing trends of today are pretty much all recycled from Y2K, and with each pully top sighting or celeb-approved platform flip flop, we've started to feel as if we're living in the past. But that's just how the cycle works - nothing in fashion is ever really new-new. And the '90s and early '00s are far from the only source of 2021 style inspiration; '70s fashion is having a moment, too. RELATED: 12 Questionable Trends From 2011 That Are, Unfortunately, Back In fact, many modern trends that are labeled as Y2K actually originated a few decades prior, pioneered by '70s icons such as Cher, Bianca Jagger, Debbie Harry, and Jane Fonda. And, it's not all flared jeans and crochet tops, either (although we're definitely feeling both of those as well). Even fairycore borrows some key elements from this cool, carefree, super sexy time in history. In case you're curious where to start in terms of '70s fashion inspiration, we've rounded up 11 iconic celebrity outfits from the decade, along with the way models, musical artists, and actresses are wearing those same looks today. Now: Kourteny Kardashian Then: Diana Ross It may be one of the more confusing (and super sexy!) trends of the summer, but you can't forget that Ross wore a simila, scrunched, string top in the form of a dress, way back in 1974. RELATED: Underwear-Tops and Upside-Down Bikinis Are 2021's Weird Yet Viral Swimsuit Trends Now: Victoria Beckham Then: Dolly Parton These babies tend to resurface every few years, and as we move away from slimmer cuts and embrace chaotic bottoms, flares have become a wardrobe must-have. Now: Olivia Rodrigo Then: Pam Grier Summer knits continue to trend, and stores are stocked with crochet tops - along with crochet shorts, crochet skirts, and crochet pants (all the things!). However, we definitely associate this textile with the '70s, and feel an urge to pair those pieces with pops of denim and large glasses. Now: Pink Then: Cicely Tyson Breezy florals fit right in with the cottagecore and fairycore craze, but slightly sheer, layered designs are actually a subtle reference to the loose, carefree clothes from this decade. Now: Bella Hadid Then: Lynda Carter Graphic tees might be considered more timeless than throwback, but you can't deny the similarities between these two outfits, especially once you factor in the casual non-skinny jeans and chain necklaces. Now: Kendall Jenner Then: Julie Andrews Annie Hall came out in 1977, inspiring people to wear structured vests. These days, it's more popular to skip the button-down when slipping one on, wearing this classic layer as a shirt. Now: Megan Thee Stallion Then: Debbie Harry When most people think of the '70s, high shine and disco designs come to mind. But don't forget about the sexy, sequined, rock-inspired looks that were in Harry's wardrobe, which looked similar to what Megan Thee Stallion wore at the 2021 iHeartRadio Music Awards. Now: Adwoa Aboah Then: Cher Halter tops are back in a big way, and everything from curve-hugging dresses to beach-friendly bikinis feature this neck detail. However, the bandeau style, which features a string tie, still reminds us of Cher, whose outfits, surprisingly enough, fit right in with those from 2021. Now: Hailey Bieber Then: Bianca Jagger We admittedly think of Y2K Christina Aguilera each time we see this twisted, social-media-approved trend. However, the crisscross style really emerged half a century ago, when it was worn by Jagger, Cher, and other well-dressed women, typically for major events and parties.

Inspired by the country’s history and culture, a new wave of Egyptian clothing is emerging. For decades, designers from all over the world have used ancient Egypt as a reservoir of inspiration. In return, these designers have left their imprint on Egyptian clothing styles. It is this rare blend of Arabic clothing heritage with western cuts that gives Egyptian designers such a unique display on the global stage. In this article, I’ll share with you a lot of interesting facts about Egyptian fashion: Without further delay…  Egyptian designers are already making waves in international fashion shows and events. Farida Temraz comes to mind, as one of the more famous representatives of Egyptian fashion. Upholding many Egyptian cultural elements, Farida’s evening gowns were described by critics as rare embroidered haute-couture.  However, it is not just Temraza carrying the Egyptian fashion flag. There is Fufa, Okhtein, and many other Egyptian designers endorsed by international celebrities such as Beyoncé. Here are the best 11 Egyptian fashion designers right now with amazing creations on sale, and loved for their stunning designs that put Egypt on the global stage!   DISCOVER Since the debut of her Autumn/Winter 2014 collection at Paris Fashion Week, Farida Temraz’s label, Temraza, has quickly risen to fame. Her fashion line got 1st place awarded from Paris Fashion Week & Best Female Couture Designer in New York Fashion Week. In fact, Farida is the only Egyptian designer that has been awarded such outstanding awards for her fashion line. The designer captures the hearts of many with opulent Egyptian clothing, touches of gold, and excellent use of drapery. The gowns are a balanced combination of opposites, boasting sleek construction paired with panels. However, the brand also often pays homage to its cultural roots by seeking inspiration from ancient Pharaohs.  DISCOVER Fashion designer Mohanad Kojak’s semi-couture creations exude a contemporary vibe, constructed with the techniques of a couturier. What started as a small passion grew steadily into an empire that Kojak established through his impeccable dressmaking skills. Mohanad’s pieces are a true work of art because they’re not just pretty, each piece tells a story. He also doesn’t care about gender roles, which is a plus, in the current context of gender-neutral clothing. The designer became a name in Egyptian fashion 2018, with growing influence in gender-free couture. He also enjoys combining unexpected elements like soft tulle with sturdy gold embellishments for his gowns. Kojak’s designs are structural, often heavily embroidered with sequins, embellishments, and beading — exquisite and full of grandeur. Overall, I love his online store, I personally think it is one of the most polished of all designers on this top 20.  DISCOVER Okhtein translates to ‘sisters’ in Arabic, was founded by siblings Aya and Mounaz Abdelraouf. Designed in various embossed leather and crafted in brass, Okhtein bags embody the art of craftsmanship and Egyptian artistry. With high-profile buyers such as Beyoncé, Gigi Hadid, and Kris Jenner, Okhtein is becoming the next ‘Made in Egypt’ designer bag.  DISCOVER Malak El Ezzawy is a world-renown Egyptian designer that has dressed many celebrities. Yet, each Malak El Ezzawy creation is completely different than the other. Malak’s designs are a true definition of elegance and style and were featured on some of the biggest fashion covers in the region. DISCOVER Taking inspiration from her grandmother’s extensive collection of fabrics, Farah El Ashiry launched Fufa, a brand described as Egyptian bohemian. At the time of its establishment, Farah knew little of garments and fabrics; yet her passion kept her going. “You’ll find that my garments are straightforward. Yet, each print is one of a kind,” said the designer.  DISCOVER Born and raised in Alexandria, Norine Farah has studied in Milan before falling in love with fashion. Norine gets her inspiration from the beauty of patterns and colors of fabrics, and her creations include custom-embellished gowns and body-hugging looks. The designer insists not to make traditional Egyptian clothing, or couture that’s too traditional: “I want to create what I feel is beautiful and Whoever wants to trust my taste, does.” After a successful appearance at the Cairo Fashion Festival in 2014, Norine was selected to represent Egypt at the World Fashion Week in Paris. Shortly after, she was nominated as Huawei Egypt’s brand ambassador.   DISCOVER Shaker founded her first fashion brand ‘SPICY’ in 1990, in Alexandria. Inspired by ancient Egyptian clothing, Shaker wants her brand to empower women, as a voice of their strength and independence. Her collections are always brimming with personality and character, with items varying from dresses to trousers. Nowadays, Dina Shaker‘s beautiful pieces are sold throughout the world, from Cairo to London, and Beirut to Paris.  DISCOVER Egyptian designer Hana Othman is the mastermind behind Zahan, the brand that has taken the Egyptian fashion industry by storm. Hana was the first Egyptian designer to participate at the St. Petersburg Fashion Week in Russia, where she presented an haute couture collection for children. So you can match your dress with your daughter’s dress!  DISCOVER Soha Murad is another Egyptian fashion designer who turned heads at the last GFF. Murad treats each piece as an entirely separate project, an approach that helps her to create unique pieces for her clients. Some of Soha’s most acclaimed creations were the dresses made for Injy El Mokaddem and Ola Roshdy.   DISCOVER Founded by Amina Khalil in 2009, Amina K is a local fashion brand inspired by traditional Egyptian clothing for pharaohs. After studying fashion design, Khalil spotted an opportunity in the fashion scene for ‘ethnic-inspired garments’, made from local textiles by Egyptian artisans. Most creations are handmade by artisans in local workshops across the city of Cairo. Amina K’s collection includes a range of women’s wear, accessories, eyewear, and men’s shirts. The pieces are unique and can be integrated into everyone’s individual style.  DISCOVER Since the launch of Zaam Designs in 2012, Egyptian designer Ahmed Azzam has been designing leather bags and clutches with a luxe touch and a vintage finish. Every bag is handcrafted in Zaam Designs’ workshop in Cairo to ensure pristine form and quality. The brand’s creations are recognized for their angular and sturdy silhouettes. Moreover, each piece is finished in Zaam Designs’ signature adornment of gold-plated brass, detailing a golden peacock logo.  DISCOVER All of Massarany’s semi-couture pieces are one-of-a-kind. Uniquely made, you can be sure that whatever piece you choose to wear from the collection, you will be the only one owning it. Christine Massarany’s debut collection was influenced by nature, earthy tones, and women’s silhouettes, suffocated by a hard and industrial setting.   DISCOVER A creation of Yasmine Yeya, Maison Yeya is a modern Egyptian fashion brand that has impressed a global audience with its mesmerizing gowns. Yasmine’s creations feature sculpted drapes and polished crafts, constructed in luxurious bridal textiles such as duchess satins and silk chiffons. Maison Yeya gowns are designed to celebrate modern elegant women that are classic as well. Interestingly enough, Yeya has never imagined that one day she’s going to become a celebrated fashion designer. She was making dresses just for fun till it hit her this could be her career. Nowadays, Maison Yeya is on a promising journey in dressing brides around the world.  DISCOVER Nour Ibrahim is a rising Egyptian fashion designer exploring original cultural lands in the art of fashion design. Nour’s tailoring expresses sharp edges and unique Egyptian styles inspired by French luxury haute-couture, and with a touch of cultural heritage. Ibrahim’s designs are tapping new lands in the art of Egyptian clothing design. ‘Luxury’ and ‘French, are the two key aesthetics that one can instantly catch in his designs. Overall, Ibrahim’s tailoring expresses sharp edges and cuts, quite unique to classical Egyptian craftsmanship.  DISCOVER Marketing themselves as premium-luxury, Plum Plu came into the scene with the aim of becoming the trend-setters of the local fashion scene. The designer redefines the concept of feminine clothing by infusing Arabic creativity into each piece.   DISCOVER If you’re a fan of simple designs and effortlessly beautiful gowns, then Deana Shaban is your ‘to-go designer’. Deana picks specific colors and blends them together in a non-traditional way. The combination confers the designer with a special style that stands out from a mile. In her view, the designer believes that there’s an individual gown for every woman. Therefore, no piece must be identical or repeated and we love the dresses she designs for Tara Emad.  DISCOVER Designing clothes for women-on-the-go, Opio aims to make you more fashionable without you having to jump through hoops. With soft fabrics and relaxed fits, all pieces feel effortlessly comfortable. Moreover, Opio’s creations look incredibly chic.  DISCOVER Sara Onsi is one of the young Egyptian fashion designers who stand out from the lot. In a short period of time, Onsi name has become a synonym for glamorous gowns, as well as trendy and stylish dresses. To top it all, her bridal wear is flawless as Onsi’s wedding dresses make that ‘once in a lifetime’ event ever so special.   DISCOVER Fresh off the farm, The King’s Mother is a brand new Egyptian clothing brand, that focuses on making blazers for women. The designer combines elements of men’s and women’s couture to make beautifully cut and perfectly tailored blazers. Some of the latest pieces include cutouts, fringe, feathers, and even sequins, alongside more traditional elements.  DISCOVER As international fashion brands started introducing and integrating modest wear or hijab-friendly garments over the past years, some local fashion designers launched brands for the same niche. One of these brands is Diva Designs, a hijabi-friendly fashion brand. Founded by Aya Magdi and Aya Saeed, this Egyptian brand creates clothing inspired by modern cultural trends. Moreover, the brand is not confined to hijab-friendly styles, since most of its pieces can be integrated into everyone’s wardrobe. I love Diva Designs’ collections, in particular for their maxi dresses and kimonos, perfect for the summertime.  At the start of the article, I’ve talked about the west influencing Egyptian clothing styles. The following six trends are a perfect example of how these two cultures blend, to create something unique. As weird as this might sound, in the heat of the Egyptian sun you’ll need an extra layer of covering, even if you’re already wearing a hijab. One of the daring stylistic experiments this year is wearing a hat with the hijab, demonstrating how to be ‘bold and beautiful. While linen has been a key material used by Egyptian designers for millennia, satin is slowly taking over.  Sating is excellent in the summer if you want to enjoy the sun but without getting too hot. Skirts in the satin fabric are another favorite trend this year. Single color outfits have been the standard for hundreds of years in Egyptian fashion. However, over the last 2 years, we’ve seen the demand for colorful outfits growing. This year, Egyptian designers took the trend to another level, by launching printed, colorful patterns. Interestingly, the printed pattern’s trend is adopted by men as well, not just women.  Velvet abayas, in vibrant colors, are back in fashion this year. Also known as the ‘hijab trend makers, abayas are hailed as staples of Egyptian fashion.  This year, if you’re looking to create that elegant look, go the extra mile and choose a striking color. Speaking of striking colors, do you know why is yellow and neon colors used in advertising and street signs? To grab attention very fast. In 2021 we see the use of yellow and neon colors in Egyptian clothing, as a way to grab attention and stand out. Even more interesting, we see the use of neon colors in Egyptian clothing for men, not just women Egyptians have always loved to adorn their bodies with all kinds of elegant pieces of jewelry. Queen Cleopatra remains a perfect example of ancient Egypt’s glamorous fashion style.  Aside from her unequaled beauty, history records often mention her obsession with gold ornaments, embellishments, beads, and gemstones. Cleopatra’s image remains one of the most powerful sources of inspiration in the times of modern fashion and haute-couture collections.  Although dressing restraint is still expected in rural parts of Egypt, modern Egyptians wear clothing styles that differ only marginally from those in Europe.  However, what makes Egyptian clothing different, is the embedded practical side. Because of the country’s hot climate, ancient Egyptians had to wear light fabrics most of the time. Even now, in 2021, most Egyptian designers make garments from vaporous linen, to confer a unique style while retaining comfort and easiness to wear.  Although 90 percent of Egyptians are Muslim, dressing to match one’s religious views is not enforced in Egypt. However, dressing decently is still important to Egyptians, and many women wear Arabic clothing that covers most parts of their bodies. Also, while unlike in most western countries where gender boundaries are blurring, Egyptian clothing retains notable differences between male and female styles. Women also wear hijabs to cover their necks and heads, or a niqab is usually used to cover just the face and head. And yet, it is not uncommon to see Egyptian women without head coverings. There are no religious restrictions on men’s attire in Egypt. For that, younger males wear polo shirts, jeans, and tracksuits. Adult Egyptian men wear western clothing styles, from business suits at work to trousers and short-sleeved shirts for everyday wear. However, older men and certain Muslim devouts refuse western-style clothing and do not wear clothing that clings to the body. Their garment of choice s galabiya, a loose-fitting ankle-length robe, along with a turban, skullcap, or a fez. The kaftan is also worn, an ankle-length coat with large sleeves, either belted around the waist or over the galabiya.  There are many types of garments that you cannot wear in Egypt, but overall, it depends on gender. For example, do not walk the streets of Cairo in your shorts and flip-flops.  Or, even worse, don’t ever go to a shopping mall in your swimming outfit, as you’ll be arrested right away! Celebrities, designers, and latest news in sustainable fashion.  Which one of these Egyptian clothing brands is your favorite and why? Are there any other Egyptian fashion trends you’d want to add to this list? Comments below, please!

Weddings,Wedding dress trends to expect in 2022 - from ethereal Princess silhouettes to dramatic sleeves and capes,Weddings are back in a big way.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/bridal-trends-2022,Bianca London ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a7063bf019dd156880a8/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bridal.jpg,,,," By Bianca London and Charlie Teather After the sh**show of a year which saw millions of weddings cancelled in 2020, engaged couples had high hopes for 2021 nuptials… that was, of course, until the year became far more like its predecessor than the millions of happy couples could've ever expected. Whilst it was estimated that over 400,000 couples continued with their plans to tie the knot in 2021 (an increase of 60% on 2020), plenty - perhaps wisely - moved their weddings back to 2022 to be on the safe side. Whilst putting your wedding on hold once more no doubt felt devastating, it did give you more time to find that perfect dress if you hadn't already. And now, with a (hopefully!) brighter future on the wedding-horizon, newly-engaged couples can also start planning the wedding of their dreams from scratch with nothing but sheer excitement. Whilst we know that the smaller ceremonies we saw taking place over the last couple of years led to an increase in sales of jumpsuits and suits after brides decided to shun traditional big white gowns, the good news for 2022 is that maximalism is back. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. In fact, anything goes. If the last year has taught us anything it's that traditions are made to be broken so 2022 weddings are all about doing you - however that looks. ""Bridal trends for 2022 are exciting and contemporary as weddings move away from the more traditional formats,"" says wedding dressing designer to the stars, Suzanne Neville. ""They include unusual sleeves with exaggerated detail and a variety of hem lengths including mini and midi styles. Suits, jumpsuits, trousers and even shorts will appear more as weddings take on many different forms with outfits created to compliment the style of the event."" If you're yet to find your perfect dress, or have just gotten engaged and are beginning the journey (congrats!), we've grilled Kate Halfpenny - founder of Halfpenny London - on all the wedding dress trends you can expect in 2022 to help you feel inspired. The trend of larger than life sleeves has filtered from the catwalks into bridalwear and brides are loving the opportunity to give a classic, simple, effortless dress the wow factor by adding a detachable sleeve. ""Three years ago, we made a pair of double-puffed bubble sleeves for Millie Mackintosh in tulle and appliqué French lace, since then the trend for sleeves has really grown,"" says Kate. There are so many options out there, you can have them as detailed or as plain as you like. ""We have some epic Mikado sleeves in the collection we launched last year and a gorgeous shrug which adds volume. It allows you to update any dress and have fun, you can be traditional if you want to be, while also playing with the drama!"" By Sophie Cockett 2022 weddings are all about choice - and the concept of layering detachable elements to transform the outfit throughout the day is going to play a key part. ""The great thing about choosing a detachable overskirt is that you can wear it over a beautiful fit-and-flare silhouette and transform from princess to goddess,"" explains Kate. ""Have fun with it and people will think you completely changed your outfit. With everyone’s excitement that weddings are able to go ahead again, I think brides will want to really make the wedding outfit even more magical. I’ve said throughout all of this that, no matter how big or small your day is, you can still wear the dress of your dreams and feel amazing. Some brides have been opting for a small ceremony now and a bigger party later and this way you can wear the simple, elegant dress for one, then add the drama of the overskirt for the other and wear your dress for both events."" By Charlie Teather, Sophie Cockett and Ali Belamant Capes have been one of the popular wedding dress trends for a while and the bridal experts don’t see them going away. In the same way that the detachable sleeves and the overskirts give you the opportunity for layering, a cape can add a magical element to a simple dress. ""I think this is especially true if you’re not into wearing a veil, which I must say is becoming more popular,"" notes Kate. As any bride knows too well, veils can really elevate any look and make the simplest of gowns become bridal. They can also make something quite lacy and pretty look more edgy and fashion-forward if you choose a 3D appliqué veil, for example. ""I’d say around 80% of our brides choose to wear one and I’m all for the drama that it brings. Whenever else will you wear a veil?!"" says Kate. ""Sustainability shouldn’t be a trend, it should be here to stay,"" says Kate - and she's spot on. From choosing to manufacture in the UK, to using all recyclable packaging, to the bags you use to carry your dress home, to what happens to the off-cuts from the fabric that brands like Halfpenny London use to construct the gowns, sustainability should be at the top of every bride's priority list. ""We repurpose or donate all of our off-cuts so no fabric ever ends up in landfill. I don’t want you to think about your wedding dress as a single wear item. I want you to think about it as something that you can wear again or pass it down as an heirloom. Your wedding dress should have a journey, like any other precious items of clothing you own."" Hear, hear. Leading on from sustainability, the trend for separates is going nowhere. If you have a smaller wedding dress budget, consider investing in separates which will last you a lifetime and you can incorporate into your wardrobe to enjoy again and again. Even big ballgown skirts can be shortened and worn with a cashmere sweater or cute cami for another occasion. The beauty of a two piece is that the choices are virtually unlimited and you can really pick and choose your top and bottom to create the exact look you want and really be the bride you want to be.

,There's a Reason This Popular Spring Dress Trend Looks So Familiar,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/empire-waist-dress-trend,,,,,,"Like virtually everyone else with a Netflix login, I am obsessed with all things Bridgerton. Knowing the season consisted of only eight installments, I prolonged finishing the series for as long as I could, but the end inevitably came. Months have passed, and I'm still drooling over the Duke and Duchesses steamy romance, though maybe not as much as I am still obsessing over the show's stunning outfits, especially all of the empire-waist dresses the women wore for their everyday engagements. RELATED: Kim Kardashian Can't Stop Posting About Bridgerton While fashion trends from the '90s and early '00s are back and booming, through her work on Bridgerton, renowned costume designer Ellen Mirojnick made a compelling argument for why regency-era styles should return, too. And, designers seem to be in agreement. Corset tops, lace detailing, and square necklines have all made an appearance on the runway this year, and I was especially excited to see that empire-waist dresses are already considered on-trend for spring 2021. An empire waistline is fitted around the bodice and falls loosely under your bust. The style is universally flattering; it accentuates tall frames and gives the illusion of length to petite statures.  It's also one of the most comfortable designs of dress options out there: The dresses are generally made with lightweight, non-restrictive materials you can breathe and move in, so they're perfect for warmer weather conditions. They're also super easy to style, so naturally fashion influencers on Instagram are all over the trend, putting their own personal touches on the piece. RELATED: Bridgerton's Lady Danbury Says Season 2 Has Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Parallels While this dress style is fun all on its own, bold accessories like sparkly clips, layered necklaces, or a celestial headband will give you even more of a wow moment. An easy, breezy yet statement-making summer look. It can be dressed up or down, depending on your choice of shoe and accessories. While empire-waist dresses have been around for a while, they also popped up in the '90s. Lean into this decade with a mini option, then complete the look with a baguette bag and chunky boots. Of course, it's a great option for when you want to get fancy. The gloves really bring home the regency vibe. Now, that you have a few ideas for how to style this trend, shop an empire-waist dress for yourself, ahead.

Shopping,This is the little-known brand our Fashion Editor can't stop wearing and it will be all over Instagram this summer,Chic and sustainable? Swoon.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/paper-london-sustainable-summer-fashion,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61389216e2e190b1f7b26096/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/hero_default.jpg,,,," By Charlie Teather I had my first fling with PAPER London last winter via a rather heavenly checked woollen coat, which is ironic when you acknowledge that they started out as a swimwear and resort label. It's even more ironic if you know that I'm allergic to wool. I snapped it up with full knowledge of its material and well aware that every time I plucked it out of the wardrobe I'd feel as though I were grabbing a fistful of needles sharp-side-up, but I went ahead anyway. Checks, a tied waist and oversized lapels will do that to a girl. Well, it will this girl. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. I went to every length to wear it as much as physically possible, pairing it with high roll-necks and long sleeves, and avoiding the temptation to fall asleep with my head against my arm on the tray-table on long journeys back home up north. And I didn't regret my choice for a second. Now we're firmly in the brand's seasonal comfort zone, I've ventured in a couple more times - via a green checked midi dress and white Broderie Anglaise two-piece - and can happily report that their spring/summer pieces are even more heavenly. Heck, I'm getting to the point that I'd even consider a woollen swimsuit if they made one. Their shapes, prints, fabrics and cuts are just a dream. Flattering but comfortable. Chic but timeless. Fun but appropriate. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. And the even better news is that Kelly Townsend, the label's creative director, is not only a wildly impressive designer, but also an incredibly conscious one, with their latest collection boasting an entirely sustainable line of swimwear. ""When we started the swimwear and resort range two years ago, we searched for the softest and highest perfomance weights we could find that were fully recycled,"" Kelly told GLAMOUR UK. ""Technical fabrics are so fascinating right now and they can virtually do anything. Turning fishing nets into luxurious swimwear jersey - which is quick drying, and factor 50SPF - is just one of them."" While shooting the brand's stunning new campaign, Kelly's awareness of these issues was only heightened. ""Having recently traveled to Mexico to shoot the SS19 campaign I really saw the impact humans have left on our beautiful shores,"" she explained. ""The turquoise waters of the past have been replaced by a thick red seaweed due to the rise in sea temperature. It's hard to fully grasp the magnitude of some of the ongoing issues or how bad they really are when we live in big cities but whilst we were there we vowed to try and change PAPER's overall footprint to become more sustainable. ""This year's goal is to bring the sustainability element to the RTW and become as a business, plastic free."" It's a goal GLAMOUR UK fully backs, with sustainability one of the brand's key focuses. So what's next for the label that may be relatively little-known in the mainstream but making a name for itself among fashion editors and celebrities alike? Well, naturally, it would be great to see brand fans JLo, Margot Robbie and Kate Hudson continue to champion their collections, but Kelly and her professional partner Philippa Thackeray are also introducing a new, and very exciting, extension which will undoubtedly garner a whole new fanbase. ""We're launching a sports collaboration in September"", she told us. ""Details are hush hush but we had a lot of fun taking PAPER's core elements - bright colour, prints and design details such as braiding - and making the ultimate sports capsule."" Looks like I'm going to have to rediscover my fitness motivation. Any excuse for more PAPER... Scroll down to shop GLAMOUR UK's 10 favourite pieces from PAPER London's SS19 collection.

By Charlie Teather While we may be still very much in the midst of a global pandemic, the arrival - albeit brief - of summer combined with our collective tentative efforts to ease ourselves out of national lockdowns has brought about a sense that there may just be a glimmer of light at the end of this very long, very dark tunnel. But despite our excitement and eagerness to get outside and spend time with the friends and family members that we've not seen in over a year, there's no doubt a collective sense of hesitation about re-entering the world of public spaces with a whole new batch of concerns to add to our list. By Charlie Teather Aside from the more obvious health anxieties, many of us find ourselves riddled with far more trivial worries. Rediscovering the art of small talk has been one such worry, but another discussion many of us have been having about post-lockdown life relates to sartorial matters. After all, has anyone worn a non-elasticated waist over the last twelve months? The dress that you put on for a Christmas Day Instagram picture before slipping back into your joggers doesn't count, by the way. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. For some, post-lockdown life introduces the much-anticipated sense of occasion that our wardrobes have been lacking over the last year. For others, the very idea of #curating a #lewk fills them with utter dread. Sometimes we just need a gentle nudge in the right direction. If you're suffering from a touch of wardrobe-block fear not, you're certainly not alone. Thankfully this is the easiest season to wing it, with the classic summer dress proving the ultimate throw-on-and-go staple year after year. Here are the 25 hand-picked styles our Fashion Editor recommends considering for a little post-lockdown sartorial simplicity...

EDITOR’S NOTE: “Eileen Fisher ticks all the boxes, from its minimalistic design and high-quality fabrics to its sustainable clothing for inclusive sizes. Eileen Fisher’s offering covers XXS to 3X where you could also find cute petite clothing collections.” Premium ($78 – $695) Shop at Eileen Fisher Shop at AMAZON Eileen Fisher is an industry leader for sustainable clothing brands and ethical clothing labels. The company believes that social and environmental injustices are the main reason the fashion industry must change its business model. For that, Eileen Fisher oversees its supply chain to ensure inclusivity and fair working wages. The sustainable clothing brand aims to end its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and reduce shipping CO2 by 25 percent.   EDITOR’S NOTE: “If you’re after a globally recognized and appreciated sustainable clothing brand, this British designer is the one for you.” Luxury (up to $4,900) Shop at Sella McCartney Shop at FARFETCH There is no sustainable clothing brand like Stella McCartney. Delightful in her stylistic duality, Stella McCartney’s creations resemble titanic collisions of natural with artificial forces. Imagine juxtaposed clashes of aesthetics; discover spirit and matter, light and dark, high and low, priceless and worthless. And, since we talk about aesthetic clothing here, imagine combinations of wasteful and saving, or haute-couture vs. fast fashion.  EDITOR’S NOTE: “Exuding a playful, bright and colorful aesthetic, Mara Hoffman’s is a sustainable clothing label known for rich, textured, and understated pieces oozing feminine power.” Premium ($30 – $650) Shop at SHOPBOP Shop at FARFETCH Inspired by personal reflections on mythology and travels, Mara Hoffman injects whimsy and unexpected details into her sustainable collections.

Check out her dresses, color-blocked skirts, and high-waisted bikinis to create that style icon image every woman aspires to become.

Pact is a Certified B Corp that goes to great lengths to ensure the transparency of its entire supply chain. From growing and harvesting organic raw materials to the final sewing – and all processes in between – Pact is as clean and responsible as possible.  EDITOR’S NOTE: “Fanm Mon’s ethical clothing pieces have a unique bohemian vibe – pair with vegan leather handbags for a super-conscious look.” Premium ($199 – $289) Shop at SHOPBOP Shop at VERISHOP The sustainable clothing brand, Fanm Mon is adored by stars such as Lauryn Hill, Morgan Stewart, and the twin sisters Cipriana Quann and TK Wonder. A modern symbol of consciousness, femininity, and freedom, Fanm Mon is a high-end sustainable clothing label of Haitian heritage. Fanm Mon references the designer’s Haitian roots, which means ‘peasant women’ in Creole. As a young woman in Haiti, Sophia was directly in contact with ‘fanm mon’ women in her grandmother’s village markets. No longer living in Haiti, the designer’s choice for the ‘Fanm Mon’ name is an homage to Haitian women’s extensive knowledge of medicinal herbs, fashion, and traditional cuisine. In this light, the designer offers her sustainable clothing brand as a unique boho fashion style gift to the entire world   EDITOR’S NOTE: “With rare combinations of prints and textures, Julia Allert creates sustainable fashion styles that symbolize the idea of a strong woman who plays by her own rules.” Premium ($77 – $618) Shop at Wolf & Badger Julia Allert is a high-end sustainable clothing designer hailing from Moldova. The label was launched as a rebellion against the wasteful fast fashion local agenda. This label is driven by a ‘break the rules’ slogan, free from animal products. Above all, Julia Allert’s unique creations are superb interpretations of a tumultuous and fascinating past.  EDITOR’S NOTE: “With flattering silhouettes and whimsical patterns, Boden is the perfect answer to those looking for sustainable dresses, swimsuits, and anything in between.” Premium ($25 – $420) Shop at BODEN Shop at WALMART BODEN is a sustainable clothing brand hailing from the UK. The label is committed to responsible sourcing, fair trade, and ethical practices across the 16 countries it has factories in. Moreover, the company has placed eco-friendly alternatives in every part of its supply chain. The brand has a wide range of apparel, from men’s chinos to children’s winter clothing. However, I am most excited about the women’s dresses for work, the beach, and everything in between. I usually pair my Boden sustainable dresses with vegan leather bags to create unique eco-friendly boho-style looks.   EDITOR’S NOTE: “Patagonia is the pinnacle of sustainable clothing. Sustainable, stylish, all products are repaired for free – for life – and if you get tired of your jacket, you can sell it back to the brand.” Premium ($25 – $899) Shop at Backcountry Shop at AMAZON Patagonia is one of the leading outdoor clothing brands that is also recognized as the leader of sustainable & ethical clothing apparel globally. Patagonia was one of the speediest defenders of environmental ethics in the activewear and outdoor apparel industry. Patagonia was also one of the first labels to manufacture sustainable clothing from recycled materials and organic cotton. Moreover, the brand also repairs customers’ damaged clothes and gear for free. The company is Fair Trade Certified and ensures a safe environment for workers and consumers.  EDITOR’S NOTE: “If you don’t pick the right size or color the first time, ABLE offers free US shipping until you find the perfect fit on your apparel, denim, or shoes.” Premium ($40 – $350) Shop at ABLE Shop at AMAZON ABLE is a rare sustainable clothing brand that focuses on women, aiming to help them provide for themselves. ABLE has grown from hand-woven scarves to a lifestyle brand with leather bags, clothes, shoes, and jewelry. The label’s beautiful bags and wardrobe staples, such as denim pieces, are made by fairly paid women who have overcome extraordinary circumstances.

The brand’s customers are women who tend to drift towards the men’s section and think: “I wish these were made for women as well.” Plus, if you’re looking for more sizes, Tradlands has a super cute plus size sustainable clothing collection. Tradlands also produce in small batches with ethical facilities and independent artisans to produce less waste. Tradlands’ shirts are a staple in any capsule wardrobe, from the button-downs to the linen tees. Overall, the brand’s essentials look great when paired with vegan handbags.  EDITOR’S NOTE: “This California-cool sustainable clothing label has an aesthetic that suits both men and women.” Premium ($48 – $498) Shop at Outerknown Shop at Huckberry If you are looking for durable, sustainable classics that transcend seasons, Outerknown will have you covered. This sustainable clothing brand knows that a conscious company must consider people and the environment before, during, and after production.   EDITOR’S NOTE: “You’re gonna love TenTree’s cozy sweaters, t-shirts, cardigans, dresses, and jackets made from sustainable fabrics like Tencel, hemp, and organic cotton.” Premium ($25 – $298) Shop at Tentree Shop at AMAZON Using only eco-friendly, comfortable materials, Tentree makes sustainable clothing essentials for the whole family.

EDITOR’S NOTE: “Reformation is a must if you’re after high-quality, trendy, and sustainable clothing for any season and occasion.” Premium ($38 – $488) Shop at Reformation Shop at FARFETCH The Los Angeles-based sustainable clothing label, Reformation, creates apparel only from eco-friendly and upcycled materials. Arguably a bohemian clothing brand – from a stylistic perspective – Patagonia is also a fabulous boutique for cottagecore, dark academia, and light academia aesthetics. I recently saw that Reformation had added extended sizing, including plus size clothing and petite clothing, to its permanent collection.  EDITOR’S NOTE: “Home of ethically & locally made sustainable clothing, Velvety has some of the most beautiful boho-style linen dresses in various colors, lengths, and inclusive sizes.” Premium ($22.50 – $284) Shop at VELVETY Velvety is a vegan, ethical, and sustainable fashion online boutique based in Melbourne, Australia that supports fair wage and eco-friendly practices.

I pair my LACAUSA tops with vegan leather jackets for an extra stylistic effect.

EDITOR’S NOTE: “For casual closet staples like T-shirts, hoodies, leggings, and more, Alternative Apparel focuses on using organic cotton and recycled materials.” Affordable (from $7) Shop at MACY’S Shop at AMAZON Alternative Apparel pieces have a worn-in, vintage look that’s timeless, so they won’t go in and out of style. Compared to other sustainable clothing brands, this label uses sustainable packaging and low-impact dyes, and it follows strict ethical standards for the factories it sources from. And it’s not just for women: there are also styles for men and kids. Fair labor practices and providing the living wage are key to Alternative Apparel.  Yes! Thanks to affordable, sustainable clothing brands, sustainable fashion is accessible to everybody. Also, buying something used is more sustainable than anything new, so it will automatically cost you less. Shopping second-hand is becoming a trend described by the fashion industry as ‘re-commerce.’ Sites like eBay, thredUP, and Poshmark make it easy to swap out your clothes, and sustainable clothing brands like Eileen Fisher and Patagonia are even selling pre-worn garments from their labels. Just be cautious that you don’t use the cost savings as an excuse to buy more since that’ll take away from it being a sustainable purchase. While ‘fast fashion ‘describes cheap garments intended for short-term use, ‘slow fashion ‘represents the opposite and is often referred to as ‘sustainable fashion. ‘ Compared to fast fashion companies, slow fashion brands consider the entire lifecycle of a product, from the design, sourcing, production, and even purchasing. As such, slow fashion brands look at everyone and everything involved in the making of fashion. From the environment to the workers and communities where garments are produced to the consumers who buy them. Celebrities, designers, and latest news in sustainable fashion.  Which one of these sustainable clothing brands is your favorite and why? Are there any other sustainable clothing brands or boutiques you’ve tried and want to add to this list? Comments below, please! I visited various sustainable fashion blogs and websites, all pretty good. However, the audio feature of your website is excellent, can you help me find something similar for my blog? I’ve been looking for a good article covering the best sustainable clothing brands for such a long time. Glad to find your article, love every brand on this list. I must say, you’ve helped me twice with this article. OInce with some school work and then you’ve confirmed my thoughts about sustainable brands and helped me purchase the eco-friendly clothes I wanted for some time but wasn’t too sure who to trust. Great site, great articles, keep doing the good work! I prefer to go through my closet and see what I might already have that will work first. I’m not much of a shopper, I just upgrade a few things from time to time. So someone help me understand something, please? Are all sustainable fashion brands vegan and are all vegan fashion brands sustainable? If not, why? Recently, I bumped into a French sustainable clothing brand called Ekojoy. It’s for youngsters looking for ethically made tees, hoodies & sweaters with cool graphics on them! But unlike some other aesthetic clothing brands (that are literally Alibaba resellers), they are completely transparent about how they make their clothing, you can even see a map of the product’s journey from beginning to end.

Fashion Trends,The fashion pack are ripping up the colour clashing rulebook – these are the bold (and surprising) new ways to wear colour this summer,We bet you’ll have never thought of these 10 clever and unexpected combos,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/new-colour-clash-rules,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a8f92677a6ca5ae35116/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tamumcpherson-_sq.jpg,,,," By Alexandra Fullerton As we slide further into summer, whether you’re WFH, staycationing or heading off on An Actual Holiday (we’re not jealous, nope, not at all) now is the time to welcome some bold colour into your wardrobe. Most of the tracksuits we’ve been lounging in during lockdown have been in neutral tones and we’ve definitely spent plenty of time in our favourite blue jeans and a white shirt. But right now there’s something about the promise of sunshine that makes brights feel right. As well as being the perfect way to shake up our wardrobes for the warmer weather aesthetically, bright colours are a proven mood lifter too. Winner winner. By Charlie Teather You can sling on anything you own that is bright and bold to feel the effects of a shot of sunshine for your style but if you’re looking for some next level inspiration, we’ve rounded-up the best new ways to wear colour for summer 2021 from our favourite insta-influencers. Spoiler: It’s all about the unexpected colour clash to amp up your freedom fashion lewks. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 1) Mix Neon With NeutralIf you’re a fan of the eternally chic beige aesthetic and have a wardrobe full or cream, oatmeal and caramel shades, update these neutrals with a flash - or two - of neon. Highlighter tones will make any pale colour pop. As seen on @SlipIntoStyle This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 2) Choose Equally Deep TonesShocking pink and emerald green (or baby pink and mint, if you prefer) is a mega mood this season. Keep the shades of a similar depth, rather than mixing a bold tone and a pastel, for optimum impact. As seen on @lornaluxe This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 3) Be Consistent With ColourChoose one colour and wear it head to toe, including your shoes and your carrier bag. Extra points for an all-orange ensemble, it was a fave shade on the catwalk. As seen on @pernilleteisbaek This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 4) Less Is Sometimes MoreDon’t panic if bold colour isn’t in your comfort zone. You don’t have to wear lairy shades all over. One statement piece can be just as effective if you choose carefully. Accessories are an ideal baby step into brightness. Try a neat bag in apple green against a chic black ensemble. As seen on @KarenBritchick This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 5) Try An Unexpected MixLavender and lemon are two sorbet shades making a surprise appearance together this summer. Unlike more classic combos like, say, navy and white or brown and cream, they look so fresh and unexpected. Bonus if you can get a tonal sunset to offset your lewk. As seen on @taramays25 This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 6) Break The RulesTraditionally a no-no because the shades are next to each other on the colour wheel, a pink and red clash actually looks cool and considered. If you’re wary of wearing two similar shades, break them up with flashes of skin and a pop of lemon yellow. As seen on @courtneysmithstyle This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 7) Wear Winter Shades In SummerIt might seem like a colour you can only wear in colder months but chocolate has made a move into warmer weather. Mixed with pale citrus sherbet, the contrast between the rich and dark brown shade and a fresh, light tone works like a palette cleanser for your wardrobe. As seen on @oliviaandalice This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 8) Green Is Summer's Standout ShadeAnother unexpected combination coming in hot is spearmint and mustard. You can blame Bottega Veneta for the prevalence of the leafy tone - Creative Director Daniel Lee first put the colour on the catwalk - and this slightly ‘off’ shade of yellow is a fashion insider’s favourite. As seen on @handinfire This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 9) Choose Several Similar ShadesWhen it comes to summer colour combos, the rules are, there are no rules. On paper it might sound weird to mix lilac, lime, orange and pink in one outfit but these acid pastels all have a similar intensity so they really do work together. As seen on @marianne_theodorsen This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. 10) Dial It DownTemper the heat of a bold, warm colour with a cool shade from the opposite side of the spectrum. This works in reverse if you have a cool toned dress, too. The icy tone of a sweet blue bag really stands out against this hot orange dress. Milky coloured sandals add an extra shot of calm.

Sustainability,The jelly shoe may be this summer’s hottest footwear trend – but it’s one of the least environmentally friendly,It's a step backwards.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/jelly-shoe-bad-for-environment,Luciana Bellini ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61389545aa3b5acf3b0dbc03/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gettyimages-829254852_sf_sq.jpg,,,," By Luciana Bellini It’s official – love them or loathe them, the jelly shoe is back as the footwear choice of the summer. Tying into the childlike resurgence the fashion world is embracing right now, the 90s favourites dominated catwalks last season, with everyone from Alexa Chung and Simone Rocha to Gucci and Giorgio Armani parading them down the runway, some encrusted with jewels, others bedecked with feathers. Online searches for jelly sandals have increased massively since April, with global fashion search platform Lyst declaring an 82 per cent month on month increase. High street stores are awash with them, and you can nab a glittery, bubble-scented pair for under a tenner. But no matter your feelings towards their style credentials, one thing is for certain: they’re one of the least environmentally friendly options around. By Charlie Teather The majority of jelly shoes are made from the petrochemical-based material PVC, which, according to Greenpeace, is the ‘single most environmentally damaging type of plastic.’ In these increasingly plastic aware times, shoes made entirely from fossil fuels may seem an odd choice for a fashion trend, and yet they’re not the only culprits – from flip-flops to sliders, many of our summer choices are made predominantly from plastic. So what to do? Several well-known manufacturers, including UK-based Juju, which supplies ASOS, Urban Outfitters and Brazil-based brand Melissa, are promising recyclable jellies. However, this can be problematic in itself, as PVC is almost never recyclable through local councils and can contaminate other plastic recycling. Melissa is working on installing recycling collectors in all its stores by the end of 2020; for now, if you head to their Covent Garden store, they’ll take back your shoes and recycle them for you. By Charlie Teather It’s not perfect, but it’s a step in the right direction. If you simply can’t resist adding a pair to your summer wardrobe, make sure it’s an investment piece that you’ll be happy to wear for years to come.

Fashion Trends,Get ready: Crop tops are the fashion find which will make all your outfits look so summery,And we found 19 of ‘em to inspire your styling options…,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/best-crop-tops,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a7e92b5bbea008292a68/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/croptopshpa.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton When crop tops started to trickle onto the catwalks, we put it down to a moment of Y2K inspired madness. But they kept on coming... and then the high street joined in... and now the sun has (finally) appeared, it’s official. Crop tops are having a major fashion moment. Having the breeze waft around your tummy is a delicious incentive to try an abbreviated top after spending most of the year wrapped up in loungewear and duvet coats. The amount of skin you leave on show is completely up to you. From a tiny sliver above a pair of high waisted trousers or an ab-revealing moment that would give Kendall Jenner cause to reconsider her signature look, you can dial up the drama (or dial it down) as you wish. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Anything that sits on your belly button, or above, could be called a cropped top, but within that framework there are a myriad of options that suit any individual style. The cottagecore puff sleeve silhouette works brilliantly as a crop to balance out all the volume up top, but fitted styles look particularly chic with high-waist linen shorts. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Team a blouse-style crop top with a full flouncy skirt for an extravagant look or choose a top with matching bottoms for a chic co-ord. The gap around your tummy will stop a bold pattern from being too overwhelming and keeps your look more casual than it might be in a similar summer dress. Crop t-shirts are a natural match for cycling shorts, an oversize blazer if it’s cool, and trainers as an option for daywear, while body-skimming styles can work with similarly figure-hugging bottoms for a sleek silhouette (or baggy jeans as a contrast.) Anything cropped and crochet calls out holiday and is an ideal match for shorts, sandals and a cocktail.

,"13 Fall Dress Trends That Actually Work For Summer, Too",,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/fall-dresses-2021,,,,,,"There comes a point each summer where the urge to shop light, breezy dresses is met by a much-too-practical voice in our head. ""How long will you really get to wear this for?"" it asks. ""Shouldn't you be thinking about the cooler weather, and shopping for fall fashion instead?"" RELATED: 8 Major Summer Fashion Trends That Are Already in Your Closet It's right, of course; slinky satin materials and twisted halter-necks come with an expiration date in may parts of the country, where temperatures tend to dip way before we're ready. But, fall dresses and summer dresses don't have to be two separate sections of your closet. There are plenty of options that easily work for both, whether they're designed that way or can be tweaked with the addition of layers. Ahead, we've rounded up a few dresses that can pull double duty. These pieces work for fall 2021's top trends, but at the same time, won't leave you sweating on an 80-degree day this summer. RELATED: The Chunky Neck Is the Fall 2021 Fashion Trend You Can Start Wearing Now Aside from helping you look sharp for that return to the office, it's something timeless that's easy one to throw on all year round. You can layer it over a button-down or a ribbed sweater, or leave it fully unbuttoned and style it as a vest. Shop Now: H&M Sleeveless Jacket Dress; $50 Lean into that preppy vibe for the rest of the year. Light Academia isn't going anywhere, and this pick will even look cute while popping out from underneath a sweatshirt. Shop now: Tory Burch Performance Pleated Golf Dress; $188 Knits are a well-known fall-friendly material, but they're everywhere this summer, too. The colors on this option will help to spice up your look from now until November (or beyond). Shop now: Tanya Taylor Joelle Knit Dress; $365 RELATED: There's Never Been a Better Time to Learn to Knit Forget the debate between slim and baggier cuts of denim - the truth is, the more the merrier, including chambray dresses. This piece will work for a variety of style preferences (preppy, '90s, '70s, cottagecore, etc.), and you can transform a simple shirt option into something all your own, just by adding layers and accessories. Shop now: Ganni x Levi's® Long Sleeve Denim Shirtdress; $375 Chaotic fashion is here! And while to some that might mean a ton of ruffles and sequins, you can easily hop on board this trend with a bold yet versatile animal print. A loose shape lets your legs breath when it's hot out, but the blanket-like nature can be cozy when temps start to drop. Shop now: Mare Mare Lynda Maxi Dress; $158 There's a time and place for neutrals, but if you're in the mood to add some color to your closet, you can't go wrong with light or bright pinks and purples, shades that were spotted in a ton of fall 2021 collections but are an obvious fit for summer. Shop now: J.Crew Button-Front Beach Dress; $80 ICYMI, cottagecore is sticking around for the remainder of 2021, so if you feel the urge to purchase a paisley print smock dress, you can feel confident that it's a good investment.

High-Street,16 Fashion Editor-approved pieces from the EPIC Marks & Spencer summer sale,So many great dresses.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/marks-and-spencer-sale,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138abe0d22f06d735f77a63/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/untitled-1_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather While those of us in the UK – particularly those looking forward to a British staycation – are still waiting for summer 2021 to really kick off, we're actually only a few weeks away from the start of autumn. Before you groan and pack away that pedicure kit, bear in mind that we are still being assured by the experts that an August heatwave is coming. And you don't have to tell us twice... While the 'end of summer' may sound entirely unappealing, once you remember that it brings with it the summer sale season things suddenly start to look a little brighter. Who ever said fashion fans were fickle? If you're feeling as though you're yet to even kick off your summer wardrobe, fear not; you're not alone and you're certainly not too late. After 18 months spent in varying stages of lockdown and subsequent stages of loungewear, it can feel both exciting and intimidating in equal measure to re-emerge back into the real world wearing real clothes. And while we always recommend shopping around in your own wardrobe before you even consider purchasing something new, once you do find those gaps that need filling – be it a more casual summer dress, a comfortable lightweight work trouser or something special for a family wedding – it's all the more satisfying when you find the one at a discounted price. By Charlie Teather Serving up some seriously epic bargains this sale season is high street stalwart Marks & Spencer, with everything from summer dresses to striped shirts, cropped trousers to floral swimsuits and even bang-on-trend ballet flats that wouldn't look out of place in the window of some of the world's chicest designer boutiques.

High-Street,Our Fashion Editor's pick of the 16 best pieces from Zara's epic new summer collection,Tired of your tracksuits?,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/zara-summer-2021-collection,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a84e2b5bbea008292a9c/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/zara.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather As we approach another pit stop on the UK's seemingly never-ending roadmap out of lockdown, it seems a large majority of us are more confused than ever as to what we are and what we aren't allowed to do and where we are and aren't allowed to go. But one thing we're all very sure of is that the minute we're given the go-ahead to safely meet up with friends and family in pub gardens and bars (swoon, they seem like a long-lost memory) we're there. While we may have all been dreaming of such an occasion for over a year(!) now, there's no denying that our collective lack of enthusiasm for clothing over the last twelve months has left us feeling a little lost on the wardrobe-front. By Charlie Teather Our lockdown uniform of uncharacteristically decadent, self-indulgent loungewear (hey, we had to get our kicks from somewhere) and high-end tracksuits may have served us extraordinarily well whilst working from home, but it's not necessarily the aesthetic we're aiming for to kick off our return to the real world. Thankfully everyone's favourite high street stalwart, Zara, has reliably stepped up to the plate, serving up a smorgasbord of fair weather pieces that not only thrill us far more than a matching hoodie and tracksuit bottom ever could but that are, in fact, just as easy to wear. Launching a particularly epic limited edition capsule collection, those with a penchant for rich red wine hues, punchy pinks and dusty oranges have been well catered for via a selection of bang-on-trend strappy bralettes, cut-out blazers and dramatic maxis. For those looking to make a slightly subtler statement post-lockdown, there are some really brilliant timeless staples with contemporary twists in the form of pastel midi sundresses, split-hem leggings and countless epic sandals.

,5 Easy Spring Trends That Are Already in Your Closet,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/easy-spring-trends-you-already-own,,,,,,"When curating your wardrobe, the transition from winter to spring is one of the toughest, strangest times of year. On the one hand, the days are longer and the weather is warmer. That often means higher hemlines, sleeveless silhouettes, and fewer layers. On the other, it's not quite summer and conditions can be unpredictable. One moment it's sunny and 70 degrees, the next it's freezing and pouring rain. RELATED: Stylists Say You Should Narrow Down Your Spring Wardrobe to Just 16 Pieces Since the season can cause so much stress and overthinking to begin with, it's important for spring fashion to be straightforward and uncomplicated. And there, are bonus points for embracing trends that you likely already own — what's better than serving up looks and saving money at the same time? It's the ultimate fashionista flex. Ahead, check out five foolproof ways to make 2021's spring trends work for you using items you probably have buried in your closet somewhere. You might just be compelled to reinvent the old in order to try something new. And let's be honest, we could all use a dose of easy-to-follow fashion inspiration these days. If you're not quite ready to give up comfy clothing but you'd still like to graduate from those sweatpants you've worn all year, this trend is for you. Knitwear offers all those same cozy vibes while being a bit more glam than your typical loungewear look. This season, go the sophisticated route, swapping your hoodie for a sweet cardigan or amping up an old knit dress with strappy sandals and a straw tote. If You Want It: JustFab One Shoulder Rib Knit Dress; $65 RELATED: Megan Fox's Pantsless Cardigan Outfit Is the Ultimate Spring Vibe Nothing evokes warm weather vibes quite like crisp, cotton eyelet fabric. These breezy, lightweight items are ideal for meandering walks in the park and drinks on the patio all night long. A flouncy frock pairs seamlessly with espadrille wedges and an oversized jean jacket is perfect for those chilly spring evenings. If You Want It: MISA Doutzen Dress; $335 Let those backs breathe and those shoulders shimmy, because it's their time to shine. With 2000s fashion returning in full force, halter tops are really going to be everywhere in the coming months. This sexy, sultry style is perfect for date night, especially when worn with tailored bottoms (think sleek leather pants) and classic stilettos. If You Want It: Harmur Classic Top Caramel; $215 RELATED: Summer 2021's Sexiest Dress Trend Is Secretly 90 Years Old What's not to love about a playful puff sleeve? With minimal effort, you can take your outfit from so-so to statement-making, and it's an easy way to elevate even the most casual bottoms. A puff-sleeved tee styles with denim shorts and clean white sneakers will quickly become your go-to look for running errands. If You Want It: Gap Puff Sleeve T-shirt; $29 (Originally $35) Florals are a springtime no-brainer, but this season, it's all about patterns inspired by the '60s and '70s. Unexpected color combinations — think green, gray, and baby blue — and soft, feminine fabrics are the elements to focus on. Coordinating heels and chunky gold jewelry will then top off your retro look.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Maybe it’s inspired by the upcoming Sex and the City reboot. Maybe it has more to do with our newfound desire to dress up for even the smallest occasions. Whatever the reason, ballet staples, like tulle skirts, wrap cardigans and square-toe ballet flats, are majorly trending right now, and we’re honestly super excited about it. Balletcore (as global shopping platform Lyst has dubbed the trend) is a fabulous combination of comfort and glamour. Think, cozy, adjustable knits and easy flats that can easily be worn with the rest of our quarantine uniforms of sweatpants and anything cashmere, but a swish of tulle and dainty bows that have the power to make us feel more dolled up. Here, 15 ballerina-inspired pieces to shop and wear this spring. RELATED: Bring on the Sequins: We’re Ready to Dress for the Roaring Twenties 2.0 Whether you took ballet lessons as a kid or not, we can all agree that it doesn’t get more classically balletic than this. It’s made from super-soft cashmere and designed to hit right at your waist to really play up your gorgeous figure. Buy it ($148) Available in sizes XS to XL Endless layers of asymmetrical tulle help give a modern spin to such a precious fabric, as does the camel brown hue. Buy it ($128) Available in sizes 00 to 16 These designer flats are one of the most searched for pairs of shoes on Lyst right now. So if you spot them in your size, we suggest you add to cart ASAP. Buy it ($625) Yes, this easy bodysuit comes in pale pink and black for those looking for a classic leotard feel, but we’re partial to the mint green hue for a fresh change of pace. (FYI, you can choose between a bikini or thong bottom for all color options.) Buy it ($35) Available in sizes XXS to XL These simple square-toe flats fit in perfectly with the balletcore craze, but they also won’t look out of place come fall when we find ourselves enamored with a new aesthetic. Ah, trends. Buy it ($130) If you don’t want to deal with wrapping and tying your cardigan yourself, look for styles like this Express knit that give the illusion of a wrap without any of the fuss of adjustable ties. Buy it ($78; $47) Available in sizes XXS to XL Worried a pink tulle skirt will look too juvenile? This easy midi features a single layer of black dotted tulle to keep things a bit more mature. Pair it with a sleek black turtleneck and sharp ankle boots for an elegant work-friendly ensemble. Buy it ($100; $70) Available in sizes XXS to XXL, also Tall and Petite OK, so ballerinas don’t typically sport tulle socks, but this whimsical pair was just too fun not to include. Wear them bunched at the ankle with sneakers, flats or heels. (They also come in beige with a black seam up the back.) Buy it ($99) We’re kind of obsessed with the gingham print on this lovely lilac number. Pair it with your favorite embroidered cardi from last summer to keep that cottagecore vibe going, or swap in a sleek bodysuit to lean further into the ballerina look. Buy it ($209) Available in sizes 2 to 12 The ties on these gorgeous flats are entirely adjustable so you can play around with tying trios of floppy bows or knotting them all into one big silk rosette. Buy it ($290) This easy wrap comes in five spring-appropriate shades to choose from and will look equally pretty with cut-off jeans as it will with a flirty midi. Buy it ($35; $33) Available in sizes 12 to 24 These lace-up flats come with two strap options—one solid black and one white printed with the Oscar Wilde quote “The secret of life is in the art.” Switch them out depending on your mood (or your outfit) or go without an ankle wrap at all. Buy it ($475) There are multiple ways to tie this super-cozy cardigan, but it’s the fact that it is made from 95-percent recycled cashmere that really sealed the deal for us. Buy it ($245) Available in sizes XS to XL A bright pink tulle maxi skirt is not for the faint of heart, but we love the idea of wearing one with tough pieces like a beige hoodie or chambray button-down and sneakers. Buy it ($148) Available in sizes XS to 3X The high crewneck of this full-seat bodysuit is flattering on just about every figure, but it’s the deep V in back that we love most of all. If you’re feeling adventurous, add a lariat necklace worn backwards to really emphasize the back cut.

,"Gen Z Just Turned This Confusing, Ugly '90s Trend Into Summer's Hottest Item",,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/skort-fashion-trend-outfit-ideas,,,,,,"I might be relatively new to fashion reporting, but with almost three decades of life under my belt, I'm old enough to know that, like plot lines in literature, there is rarely any fashion trend that hasn't been done before. As time goes on, clothing items get recycled and reimagined; the next generation finds new ways to wear them and, sometimes, they even try to rename them (stop trying to make ""flared leggings"" happen — they're yoga pants). So when I'm casually scrolling through TikTok and come across a video in which a Gen-Zer is in awe of ""skirts that are shorts,"" aka skorts, I feel the need to show them the light. RELATED: 16 Questionable '00s Trends That Have, Unfortunately, Returned In the original clip posted by @talllivingtiny, the young woman fumbles with her camera and, almost breathlessly, declares, ""I gotta show you this."" She quickly backs away from the camera and exclaims, ""Skirts!"" before lifting her hemline, adding, with even more enthusiasm, ""that are shorts!"" She can't believe it. I can't believe it. Neither can fellow Tiktok content creator, Stu, otherwise known as @janikon_, who's left almost speechless in his reaction video. ""Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so old,"" he says, rubbing his eyes. ""Are you… are we…,"" he adds through sniffles. ""Are you saying you were born after skorts, and you think it's new?"" Now, I realize the video is probably (hopefully) a parody of sorts, but to think that there very well might be people read this who've never seen or worn a skort outfit — that the concept is so new to them that they don't even realize (or haven't googled) these wonderful bottoms have been around since the late 1800s — hurts my soul. Especially because aside from being a true wardrobe staple in 1990s, the skort has such a rich history in general. The skirt-shorts hybrid was originally designed with the sole purpose of allowing females to ride bicycles more comfortably, and they were far from fashionable. In fact, the shorts half of the first skort weren't really shorts at all. Deirdre Clemente, a professor of history at the University of Las Vegas specializing in the fashion industry, told Atlas Obscura skorts weren't anything like the traditional shorts we wear today. They were basically pants ""more like a skirt with a flat front, and they were very baggy,"" she told the outlet. RELATED: We're Still Not Over the Confusing '00s Dress-Over-Pants Trend — and Now It's Back But, despite being considered ""athleticwear,"" the skort caused some controversy, as, per The Atlantic, the Victorian era was coming to a close and the garment not only exposed a woman's ankles (*gasp*), but it inevitably paved the way for less restrictive clothing to come to fruition. So, while to the average 90s and 2000s kid a skort is a comfy, slightly questionable, and in many cases, what we'd consider a conservative alternative to the traditional skirt, it's actually a very symbolic item of clothing that represented the beginnings of a shift in how women dress. And, I'm pleased to report it's making a comeback. Based on outfits I'm seeing on fashion influencers, skorts are definitely experiencing a resurgence. To pay further homage to the skort and all it's glory, I reached out to a few stylists for their best tips on how to style this gem of a throwback in 2021. Read on for a little inspo and a whole lot of nostalgia. While the skort has a rich history that goes back centuries, there's no denying the innovative bottom was a '90s wardrobe staple. To lean into that nostalgia, head stylist at Tobi, Joanna Angeles, suggests pairing the piece with a baby tee or micro crop top and either sneakers with tube socks or chunky platform sandals. ""I would also take it one step further and add fun, kitschy beaded jewelry, a baguette bag, and glass or clay bubble rings for a '90s throwback vibe,"" she says. RELATED: You're Probably Layering Your Necklaces Wrong Still on a matching set kick? Lara Knight, VP of design denim and bottoms at American Eagle, tells InStyle you can DIY your own co-ord skirt set by layering a classic jean jacket paired with a jean skort. ""We're all about double dipping in this iconic material,""says Knight. Stitch Fix stylist Krista Gonzalez says that one of the most approachable and timeless pairings is the waist-accentuating wrap skort and striped tee, which, when worn together, creates a coastal-living, Hamptons vibe. ""Not only is this a great way to kick off summer fashion, but it creates a feminine yet sophisticated look that can incorporate a layering piece — such as a denim jacket — for chilly mornings,"" Gonzalez says. ""Paired with crisp white sneakers, you'll feel stylish and comfortable for a weekend of activities, from running errands to a stroll on the beach."" RELATED: I'm 5'0 and I Swear These Three Simple Shoe Tricks Make Me Look Taller Whether you have plans to rendezvous with a special someone or happy hour with the girls outside your apartment, Gonzalez tells InStyle a skort with an asymmetrical hem is sure to make a statement. From there, ""style with an understated, yet romantic silk camisole on top and a pair of square toe block heels to pull it all together."" Don't forget: Skorts were originally designed for athletic purposes. So, why not incorporate the piece into your activewear wardrobe? For bike rides and morning jobs, Gonzalez recommends grabbing a sporty low-maintenance running skort and an athleisure-inspired half-zip to ""keep you comfortable (and covered)."" Contemporary fashion is never short on trends, so pick and choose the looks you like and incorporate them into your skort outfit. For spring 2021, Gonzalez suggests experimenting with tops that feature of-the-moment prints, like '60s inspired ditsy florals or tye-dye, and hey, if you're feeling bold, fruit and vegetable fashion is a thing now, too. Classic silhouettes are key if an elevated casual look is what you're after. A fresh white tee tucked into a pinstripe skort, styled with your go-to denim jacket is a great way to accomplish this, Gonzalez tells InStyle. Plus, she says the combination will help you ease your way into the season's hottest trend.","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us Gen Z Just Turned This Confusing, Ugly '90s Trend Into Summer's Hottest Item Layer On The '90s Fashion Trends DIY a Co-Ord Set Make It Nautical Pair It With Romantic Pieces Embrace Athleisure Style It With Other Current Trends Keep It Casual Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

Inthefrow,GLAMOUR's fashion columnist Inthefrow reveals how to pack the ultimate summer capsule wardrobe,Your holiday wardrobe sorted.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/in-the-frow-victoria-magrath-capsule-holiday-wardrobe-glamour-column,Victoria from Inthefrow ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138cbb3f5e39d30c69b5a3f/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/7-02_hero.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Victoria from Inthefrow If you follow me anywhere on social media (you'll find me @inthefrow), then you’ll probably be well aware by now that I travel, A LOT. This year I seem to have picked up the pace with more than two trips per month, although I promised myself a one trip a month maximum. It just means that I can travel, pack a full suitcase of clothing to take pictures with and try out new swimwear and outfits every few weeks. I feel extremely lucky for that reason. So, with that in mind, I thought I’d delve into what swimwear styles are big this summer, what products I can’t live without on holiday and which holiday styles you could try out yourself for your summer holiday. Grab your suitcase, let’s get packing! This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Cut outs, mini bikinis and split swimsuits cannot be escaped this season - those are the styles I’ll be rocking, anyway. I’ve seen so many swimsuits with gorgeous side cut-out details this season, whether it’s eyelets or lace-up sides to add a touch of detail to a plain swim. For those who prefer to stay away from print or embellishment, this is a great choice, as the detailing stays sophisticated and minimal to each of your sides. Zimmermann £345 As another swim option, the mini bikini is literally the smallest amount of fabric that almost resembles non-wired lingerie. It’s supposed to look minimal and chic and on the right body type, can look so effortless. Go for ribbed fabric for a really flattering look. Black ruched bikini, £12, Topshop And, finally, the split swimsuit, which we also saw a lot of last season. I’ve already dabbled in this style and I seriously love it. Having a top and bottom half that meets at the back to form a full swimsuit, allows you to show off your stomach and neckline for a really flattering look. Topshop, £29 This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. From beach to bar, or bar to your sun lounger, you’ll spend so much time in a beach cover-up whilst you’re away, so why not buy one you love to wear, and don’t just use out of necessity. This season, it’s about feminine, floral, floaty fabric playsuits and dresses or stunning silk or linen trousers that you can wear with your bikini top to match. Whistles, £99 This season, it’s all about the comfortable slides. Slide them on and off as soon as you get to the pool, whilst you’re walking along the promenade or whether you’re going to and from the airport. The leather slides are such a winner for comfort and ease and this season they’re looking more fabulous than ever. Salt Water, £55 I love nothing more than getting myself dolled up for an evening in the late sunshine. Your skin looks sun kissed, your whole body is glowing and your hair has that salt spray vibe that you could never get at home. I find that minimal make up always works best with the holiday mood and all you need is a cool outfit to do all the talking. Zimmermann Dress, £495 For the daytime, I hate to feel like I’m being too fussy with my clothing. Something simple and lightweight that doesn’t make you feel flustered in the heat. It goes well with your sliders, every cross body bag that you own, and makes you feel gorgeous to boot. For this, the midi dress, loose shorts or playsuits are a favourite, but I found some amazing midis. Here's one I love. River Island, £40 Enjoy your packing!

By Charlie Teather While we may technically be whispers it out of lockdown at long last, it's going to take a little bit more than the reopening of clubs to tempt us back into our most uncomfortable stilettos. Luckily for those of us who've spent the best part of the last eighteen months wearing nothing but our favourite slippers - or bare feet during this heatwave, it goes without saying - summer 2021 saw us coming and conveniently prioritised comfort above all else when curating its key footwear trends. That's right, there's not a stiletto in sight. We'll let you take that big sigh of relief before we get to the nitty gritty... By Charlie Teather So now that we're all slightly less intimidated by the prospect of putting on a pair of actual shoes again, what can we expect to be tempted by this season? Unsurprisingly the SS21 runways were rife with sandals aplenty, but there were three styles in particular that reigned supreme and emerged as undeniable trends. The padded flip flop - which was spotted on the catwalk at Acne Studios, Kenzo, Jacquemus, Stella McCartney and Coperni - is one of team GLAMOUR's favourites, providing a softer, squishier take on last summer's staple shoe. The platform was the second sandal trend to emerge from the shows, with Gabriela Hearst, Ulla Johnson, Erdem, Simone Rocha, Versace, Molly Goddard and Altuzarra all championing the eighties-inspired look. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. An elevated twist on the dad sandal was the third footwear trend that fashion editors and buyers alike fell for, thanks to the likes of Jason Wu and Anna Sui who gave the stompy staple a feminine makeover via printed fabrics and bold embellishment.

Fashion Trends,This is the surprising trend you'll see all over Instagram this spring,Fashion week's street style set are all over it.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/snakeskin-print-fashion-trend,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61388ea14501b1fdc56b9e00/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gettyimages-1127082435_sq.jpg,,,," By Charlie Teather So how long after everyone started wearing leopard-print last season did you start hating it? We gave it a good six weeks before we had to gracefully retire from the trend. But, in the same way we jumped on that one, there's another animalistic look that'll be making its way into all of our wardrobes come spring, and despite its very subtle similarities to the aforementioned look, it's a fresh enough take that we can't wait. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Spotted splashed across the street style set throughout fashion week, anyone with their finger even remotely on the pulse will have noticed the sudden influx of snake-print pieces. Making a statement splashed across leather-look trousers, decorating a kitten-heeled boot or dominating a Mac-like trench coat, it was the surprise hit of the season. And, according to shopping app LIKEtoKNOW.it, searches for 'snakeskin' pieces have increased by 300% each month since August. It seems we aren't tired of animal print after all! Scroll down to gather inspo from the hottest street style looks outside the global shows before you snap up the trend yourself in time for spring...

Sustainability,They're the opposite of fast fashion – these are the made-to-order fashion brands you're going to be seeing everywhere this summer,The perfect slow fashion solution.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/made-to-order-fashion,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a7dba35312eec2783fd7/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/molbythelabel_sq.jpg,,,," By Alexandra Fullerton This World Environment Day, we can’t help but wonder, how can we do our bit to atone for the huge impact fashion has on the planet? Switching up our habits is the least we can do to become more sustainable shoppers. But when you’re doing all you can - renting clothes, choosing sustainable fabrics, mending and repairing, wearing your wardrobe 30 times... what’s next? By Alexandra Fullerton Wearing something once and binning it is a style sin, but what about the stuff that never even makes it out the store?Over production is one of the fashion industry’s most shameful secrets. According to made-to-order brand, This Is Unfolded, 30% of new clothes never even get sold. While ASOS is really clear that all their returns are put back up for sale, so many brands aren’t transparent on their clothing’s journey and too many unsold items end up in landfill or incineration. Why do so many clothes get made and never sold? It’s actually cheaper for manufacturers to overproduce - although the cost for the planet and garment workers is high. In the quest for profits sustainability doesn't get a look-in. By Alexandra Fullerton So, what if there was another way? Enter Made to Order fashion. We’re stepping off the hamster wheel of fast fashion to make a difference. We know you still need a fashion fix (hey, us too) but made to order allows you to shop consciously without creating overstock. Made to order sounds fancy but this isn’t five figure couture. At the moment, the Made To Order market is mainly made up of smaller, indie labels, but Ralph Lauren is set to be the first big name brand to join the revolution. They are currently trialling 'Create Your Own' garments online - where shoppers can choose from hundreds of colour options - but the goal is to eventually make all of their garments from scratch. Until then, GLAMOUR has found five brilliant independent brands that will shake up your wardrobe with their bespoke designs. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This British-based brand has blown up due to their legion of die-hard fans, dedicated to showing off the label’s made-to-order garments on social media. Founder Karina Molby creates every single order herself in a bid to reduce fabric wastage and cut carbon emissions. Diaries at the ready; the next order date for Molby’s cult gingham dresses is June 6th... This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Patchwork jackets made from vintage quilts are having quite the moment. Yes, the High Street has cottoned on to their cottage-core appeal but for an authentic version, that will last way longer than the trend does, The Wild Folk Studio have an array of coats and jackets to shop. If you’re lucky enough to already have a vintage quilt or blanket, they could turn that into a coat for you, too. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Bringing back the magic of waiting for something special, Mary Benson creates bespoke dresses (and cushions, mugs, berets, blouses and bags...) using only vintage or deadstock fabrics. Then she may add a handprinted illustration or two for her signature bohemian vibe. It’s a true labour of love and a family business, even Mary’s mum works for the brand' customer service! This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This Is Unfolded allows customers to build a bespoke order through their brand new business model, focusing on basics at high street prices. The collections aren’t trend-led, although they do feel current, and the savings made from not being wasteful are pumped back into improving the lives of garment workers. Shoppers can pick three pieces in each order that will last several seasons... This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A mega plus point of buying made to order is that it’s created to fit your body, whatever your size and measurements. Mia Layzell has an “all bodies welcome” policy and offers made to measure blouses, collars, corsets and scrunchies. Drops sell out fast so keep en eye on her instagram for details of the next availability.

Above all, given its geographical location at the intersection of Europe with Asia, Modanisa is one of the best online marketplaces for Arabic clothing right now.  Shop Now I found Shein to offer an excellent selection of Arabic kaftans and abaya for women. Affordably priced, Shein’s Arabic style abayas come in timeless and chic designs you won’t find anywhere else. I also recommend Shein for modern kaftans and Arabic cover-ups made from sustainable fabrics.  Shop Now Founded in 2006 in Melbourne, Australia, Redbubble is an online marketplace for print-on-demand products based on user-submitted artwork. With offices in San Francisco and Berlin, the company operates by allowing users to sell their own artwork as decoration on various products. Products include prints, T-shirts, hoodies, cushions, duvet covers, leggings, stickers, skirts, and scarves. While not a typical store for Arabic clothing, Rebbubble is great if you’re looking for unique hand-made Arabic clothes with a modern touch.   Shop Now Zazzle is another ‘print on demand’ online marketplace that offers great Arabic fashion and general products ranging from mugs, phone cases, clothing, stationery, and more.

Find anything Arabic fashion-related here, from abayas to kaftans and modern jilbabs, for any taste, any price, and any part of the world.  Shop Now DHgate.com is a Chinese business-to-business and business-to-consumer online marketplace. Populated by Chinese sellers who sell items wholesale, DHgate is an Amazon-like company, but three to five times cheaper. Ideal for Arabic clothing retailers seeking to purchase apparel in bulk to resell for a profit, there are plenty of dedicated manufacturers to Islamic garb willing to sell piece by piece.   Shop Now Launched in 2009, EastEssence is an online marketplace for affordable modest Islamic clothing. The company transforms modesty into simple yet high utility abayas, jilbabs, and kaftans that showcase your value, faith and improve your image.

Shop Now Launched in 2010, AliExpress is an online retail service based in China and owned by the Alibaba Group.

As such, AliExpress is an excellent online marketplace for any Islamic clothing you’d wish for. Check out their Dubai hijabs, double-layered Saudi abayas, Moroccan tunics, hijab pins, dishdasha, thobe, and niqabs.  Shop Now Milanoo is a great online marketplace for everyday use hijabs and caps, or even for special occasions such as hajj, umrah, Eid, Eid-al-Adha, Eid-al-Fitr, Masjid, and Jummah. The company also stocks a wide range of Islamic attire and clothing options, including Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and Arabic clothing.   Shop Now Just like Amazon, Walmart needs no introduction, as one of the largest online stores for anything you need, from clothes, to shoes, accessories, and so on. Yet, not many of you know that Walmart is an absolute treasure when it comes to Arabic-style accessories. From necklaces to watches, Walmart is an online store you must visit if you seek modern Arabic accessories you can’t find anywhere else, at discounted prices.  According to the style and the region where it is come from, Arabic clothing has various names. Classic Arabic outfits comprise a thawb – the Arabic word for garment, spelled thobe or tobe – and izaar, worn underneath.  The thawb looks like an ankle-length dress with long sleeves and is worn in the Arabian Peninsula, Middle East, Iran, and some African countries. But, modern Arabic apparel is more than just thawb; there are kaftans, abayas, hijabs, scarfs, and lots of accessories, in classic and modern styles.  To say that most Arab women wear hijabs, jilbabs, niqabs, or abayas, and most men wear keffiyeh or thaubs, would be stereotypical and even wrong. That’s because, from the Middle East to Singapore and from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, Arab’s perception of decency and modest clothing continues to change. Also, the continuous adoption of western values influences the local politics of each country uniquely, reshaping old rules regarding Arabic clothing choices.  For example, the law in Lebanon is quite relaxed when it comes to women having to cover their hair. On the contrary, in Saudi Arabia wearing a niqab is a must. Finally, there’s the generational gap. Older people are still wearing traditional Arabic clothing while the younger ones find them outdated and out of style. Therefore, to give you a better understanding of how most Arabs are dressing now, in 2021, the section below details Arabic clothing choices, by country. The main Arab clothing dress code depends according to the country we’re looking at, and even the age of the wearers.  However, one dress code rule is sure, and that’s to dress modestly, or decently. When it comes to Arabic clothing, four main geographic areas define the latest fashion trends:  Walking through the streets of Rabat or Tunis, you’ll see many men and women donning Western clothes. But, how can you tell if they are Moroccan or Tunisian, only by their outfits? It is quite easy; by looking at the robes or headgear, as these are unique to each country. Most Moroccans still wear the djellaba, a flowing and comfortable unisex hooded tunic with long sleeves. Part of the national heritage, djellaba, is made in bright colors for women and earth tones. Moroccans might accompany the tunic with traditional slippers – called balgha. Traditional balgha are mostly yellow but nowadays, you can find them in almost all colors. Spotting traditional Arabic outfits in Tunisia may be quite challenging, in particular in big cities. But, a trip to the medina in Tunis, or attending a wedding should give you a rare chance of admiring the beauty of traditional Tunisian Arabic clothes. Much like in Tunisia, Western culture influences Algerian Arabic fashion. Thus, seeing teenagers wearing typical Algerian attire might be difficult. However, older men and women continue to wear two typical items of Arabic clothing, as below:  Nowadays, young Libyans tend to wear jeans and t-shirts. However, if you leave the city and visit rural areas inhabited by the Berbers, you’ll see original Libyan attire. Walking through the streets of Cairo is a great way to see a wide range of Arabic clothes and attires. From women wearing a niqab to full hijabi girls, up to ladies who don’t cover their hair at all. Equally, in Cairo and other big cities, it appears that Egyptian men do not wear classic Arabic clothing but polo shirts and jeans. However, fellahin (farmers) and people living at the periphery of Cairo still prefer traditional and breezy attires.  Like the Maghreb countries, western clothes are predominant in the Levant, especially in big cities such as Beirut or Damascus. However, many local garments and attires can be seen in big cities and not just in the countryside. So far, we’ve seen that all al-Maghreb countries have some Arabic clothing pieces in common, such as the gandoura or the burnous, a hooded djellaba. While these rules apply across the Levant, some particular headgears or tunics are unique to each country. In Jordan, western-style clothes are widespread, in particular in the western part of the country’s capital, Amman. However, it is common to see more traditional and conservative attires in downtown and eastern Amman, and of course, in the smaller towns. Like in Jordan, traditional Palestinian clothes have been replaced with an American-European mix. Nowadays, it represents support for the Palestinian cause. Among all the Arab countries, Lebanon deserves, arguably, the title of most fashionable and stylish. Women tend not to wear hijab, in particular in the capital city, Beirut. Much like the other Levantinian countries, Syria sees its men and women opting for Western-style clothes. Older women wear hijabs, jilbabs, abaya, and niqabs. Similarly, some older men can still be seen with a keffiyeh and long tunics. Traditional Syrian clothes of high quality, are ornated with beautiful embroideries in black and red. However, these traditional Arabic garments are now worn in the countryside, at special occasions. ‘That’ – Dyed black and red and often accompanied by a belt of the same color, the Syrian ‘that’ is a garment for women.  It is easy to spot people from the Gulf as these countries have persisted in wearing traditional Arabic clothing styles. Most men in the Gulf wear a white and long tunic called dishdasha to keep them cool against the region’s heat. This tunic is often worn with short sherwal trousers, ghutra, white headscarf, or keffiyeh, in the colder season. Women wear wide, long robes called abayas, matched with a Shayla hijab (an Islamic headgear that shows some hair) and a niqab. Even if the men’s thobes and women’s abayas might seem the same everywhere in the region, there are small dressing details between Qatari, Kuwaiti, and Omani styles. Saudi men and women are still wearing traditional Arabic clothing. In RSA, adherence to Islamic clothing and moderate dressing for both sexes is an absolute must. Even if only 25% of the 2.1 million inhabitants have Qatari origins, there is a robust national identity expressed through clothes. Qatari fashion is similar to the Saudi Arabian one, but it is more colorful, especially on the women’s side. The most common garments are: The 1.4 million Kuwaitis differentiate themselves from the 2.3 million ex-pats that live in the country because of the language they speak and the way they dress. Here are the typical Kuwaiti garments: Shemagh: the Kuwaiti shemagh is white and characterized by a scale shape when observed from the front. Dishdasha: Similar to the classic one, the Kuwaiti dishdasha has a distinguishing one-button collar.  Bahrain might not be as known as Saudi Arabia when it comes to Arabic clothing and culture, but it is nothing short regarding history, biodiversity, and, of course, fashion. Bahrain’s traditional clothes are in line with other Gulf countries but have some unique features which differentiate them from the neighboring countries. The UAE has a highly complex Arabic clothing fashion panorama. While Dubai is the most progressive state among the Emirates in terms of clothing, all other areas remain conservative. Westernized fashion has evolved here incredibly fast. If in the past sirwal and burqa were a must-wear for women. However, these pieces of classic Arabic clothing have been replaced with abaya in recent years. Moreover, the classic white thobe now comes in a wide variety of colors. The southern sultanate is very mindful of its culture and national heritage, Arabic clothing included. That’s why traditional dress is compulsory for all employees in the public sector in Oman. Western-style clothes have no space in the country, except for tourists, of course. Traditional Omani attires could not be complete without:  This country has preserved an extraordinary heritage in terms of history and traditions. Yemeni clothes are just another expression of how much Yemenis follow their customs. As such, Yemeni’s Arabic clothing choice is a clear indication of the region they come from, be that the mountainous North, the coastal area of the West, or the tribal area of the South. Still, it is not uncommon for men to wear Western clothes in the cities. Let’s see what makes Yemeni’s attires different from all the other Gulf countries: The fashion style of Sudan is unique and easily recognizable. Sudanese wear many of the Arabic garments widespread in the rest of the Middle East. But, usually, Sudanese clothing has a brighter and more colorful version, which suggests us of other African countries. While Western clothes are found in big cities, some people still prefer traditional loose-fitting pieces. Let’s see what items of clothing you cannot miss if visiting Sudan:  If white robes and black veils are the only things that pop in your mind when you think about Middle Eastern clothes, then this article should help. In recent years, Arabic clothing has become a complex reality where local traditions and Western culture mix. From Morocco to Oman, the concept of ‘modest dress’ and traditional Arabic garments is changing, country by country, style by style. The Middle East is a kaleidoscopic universe for Arabic clothing for both, men and women. And while western culture continues to influence Arab clothing styles, in certain Islamic countries, traditional garments remain a must-wear.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Summer is a wonderfully vibrant season, but there are a few shades in particular that you’ll soon be seeing everywhere you look. Searches for these five hues have been steadily growing in popularity on the global shopping platforms Lyst and ShopStyle for some time now, and a quick scroll through Instagram reveals lots of influencers are already incorporating them into their summer wardrobes. Here, the top color trends to keep an eye on, plus tips on how to wear them no matter your style. RELATED: The 20 Best Plus Size Maxi Dresses to Add to Your Closet This Summer It began with a flurry of women sporting Argent’s hot pink suit during the election, but Barbie-approved hues have continued to grow in popularity all through 2021, with no signs of slowing down. For those who admire the head-to-toe look, try a flowy maxi dress or voluminous midi instead of a structured suit (they’ll feel more breathable and comfortable in the summer heat). Or you can add just a few pops here and there in the form of a button down shirt with neutral hued shorts or a vivid handbag paired with a floral sundress or casual jeans. Shop the trend: In The Style dress ($45); Cece top ($69); NBD top ($98); Yaura Plus pants ($103); Krisa dress ($187); Cult Gaia skort ($258); Tanya Taylor dress ($465) This pale springy hue may not call as much attention to itself as bright pink, but it definitely stands out in its own way. Much like camel, tan or beige, sage tends to look pretty luxe, even if you’re rocking more affordable pieces rather than designer duds. And much like those light brown shades, it can easily transition from spring to summer to fall, so it might well be worth the investment if you do decide to splurge. Pair this delicate green with other lighter colors—like white, tan or any pastel—rather than bold patterns or vibrant pops to really let it have its moment in the spotlight. Shop the trend: ASOS dress ($40); ASTR the Label bodysuit ($68); Wilfred dress ($78); Pretty Lavish top ($72); Eloquii jumpsuit ($120); Staud top ($175) Maybe it’s inspired by our newfound love of nature or maybe we’re all just drawn to its calming vibes, but green is the It color of 2021. After sage the most popular variation is deep emerald, a hue most often reserved for the holidays or winter months. But it turns out it works equally well for summer, so long as it’s worn with more subdued shades, rather than a multitude of other gem tones or brights. Stick with white, gold or brown accessories, or paler hues if you really want to add a few other colors to the mix. Shop the trend: Wednesday’s Girl top ($22); Halogen top ($39); Superdown romper ($66); Ann Taylor pants ($98; $80); J.Crew shorts ($98); Alice + Olivia dress ($275); Shoshanna dress ($398) Unlike sage green, this light color works super well both on its own and as a background hue for more eye-catching shades. In fact, it looks particularly great paired with bright pink, and can be worn as a neutral hue with just about any other color you like. Our favorite way to wear it, however, is with other shades of blue, like cobalt or cerulean and pops of gold jewelry. Shop the trend: ASOS trench coat ($111; $38); Nordstrom camisole ($49); Eloquii top ($65); Hill House dress ($125); Amanda Uprichard dress ($216); Theory pants ($275); Faithfull the Brand dress ($319) Though most women are sticking to pastels this year, mustard yellow and even neon are having a moment. Folks often assume yellow is a hard color to pull off, but the trick is just to find the right shade for your skin tone. Those with cool undertones look best in daffodil, lemon or superbright yellow, while buttercup, goldenrod and honey hues work better on those with warm undertones. Shop the trend: New Look dress ($44); Topshop cardigan ($62); Liverpool Los Angeles shorts ($68); Vince Camuto top ($69); Levi’s shorts ($70); Hope & Ivy dress ($119); Eloquii dress ($125); Bardot blazer ($169) RELATED: 8 Fashion Trends, from Clogs to Corset Tops, that Will Be Huge This Summer Enter your registered email below!",Trending Share The Top Color Trends to Mix and Match This Summer  1.

Fashion Trends,We found 21 amazing towelling fashion buys that will make you look summery - but still keep you cosy in this damn weather,"Quirky, retro, practical and fun - towelling is the solution for every style situation.",https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/towelling-trend,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61389ac6a8f6b78280dd7493/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/heartzeena_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton Every summer the same classic fabrics come round (gingham, linen we’re looking at you…) and while we love, love, love a perma-trend, we also love it when the fashion world throws us a curve ball. For 2021, terry towelling has entered the arena. Yep, the same fabric as the actual towels you dry yourself on in the bathroom is a having A Moment. Whether you’re scrolling or shopping you can’t escape the cute - and cosy - fabric. And that might have something to do with towelling’s popularity. In a summer (so far) that has seen our raincoats get more wear than our bikinis the pastel shades and tactile feel of towelling make it seasonally appropriate - but it’s also ideal for snuggling up in, if your pub garden catch-up gets rained off. If you’re struggling to make the easy transition from tracksuit to ‘real’ clothes (we feel you) it’s an easier step to take if you choose a comfy fabric like towelling, too. The high street is swimming with towelling two-pieces. Think the Florida Granny co-ord but plain, not patterned. Sweet pastel shades of lemon, lilac, mint, sky and candy pink are most prevalent but neutral tones of chocolate, oatmeal and cream look chic too. Both colour stories are easy to style up into an on-trend outfit. If you don’t fancy doing a towelling co-ord, H&M’s terry crop top will look unexpectedly edgy under a blazer, while COS's sweatshirt will make a smart pair of trousers more relaxed. Mango’s towelling shorts are ideal for the beach but wear them with a white shirt, heels and bold jewellery to make a fashion statement in town. Or try an easy one-piece dress, like the smocked sundress from Faithfull The Brand, ASOS’s dip-dye shirt dress or the retro printed wrap dress from Racil. Towelling also makes the most brilliant shoes, particularly for pool and beach days. ARKET have a vibrant striped version while Zara’s criss-cross slides are ideal for WFH and heading out and about. Sling all your essentials into Pull & Bear’s tote bag, twist your hair up into a towelling scrunchie from My Accessories or pile it all under Mango’s towelling bucket hat. British Summertime, we are ready for you. Bonus: if your wine goes astray, you’ll be ready to mop up any spills. Don’t you just love practical fashion?

,Summer's Hottest Swimsuit Trend Looks Fancy and Expensive — But It's Not,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/lurex-swimwear-fashion-trend,,,,,,"Oftentimes, we catch ourselves gravitating toward same old swimsuits: The classic solid bikini, something with a polka-dot or floral print, a colorblocked mix, etc. But you're really looking to spice up your swimwear collection this summer? Consider adding a little sparkle and shopping some lurex designs. The metallic sheen will ensure that, even if you're wearing a simple black maillot, you'll have the most light- and eye-catching look around. RELATED: The 12 Best Places to Buy Swimsuits in 2021 Historically, lurex was actually crafted of aluminum-coated-plastic that was then spun into yarn. Today, though, it's combined with other threads, such as spandex, nylon, and elastane to create stretchier silhouettes that give it that true '70s and '80s disco feel. Some are more uniform in silvery glaze, while others are woven in a more textured manner, giving off a glitter-filled look that creates depth of light and a rainbow of hidden hues. In 2021, lurex swimwear makes hitting the beach or sitting poolside extra fun, and, might we add, the look is championed by some of your favorite celebrities. Think: Beyoncé, Kourtney Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez, and more, chronicling their yacht tips and family beach vacations in this shiny yet sturdy material. Plus, don't be surprised if slipping into these pieces instantly makes you feel as if you're rocking out on the dance floor at Studio 54. The retro vibe can do that to you. RELATED: Kendall Jenner Paired a Tiny Bikini With Cowboy Boots The best part is, the lurex swimsuit trend can be translated into any silhouette you choose. Want to go full-blown '70s and opt for a deep V-neck halter top? Go for it. Or, perhaps you're partial to a sporty tank bikini? You've got it. The world is your oyster, thanks to the many variations that are available, and, more often than not, you can find one that fits within your budget. This material has the ability to look expensive, but there are plenty of options under $100. From high-waisted bottoms to athletic one-pieces; French bikini tops, string silhouettes and more, shop some lurex swimsuits that are bound to make huge statement this summer.

,We're Finally Giving Into the Cute But Confusing Summer Knits Trend,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/summer-knitwear-trend,,,,,,"No, it's not a typo and, no, we don't have our seasons mixed up: Knitwear is hot (and we mean that in a good, non-sweaty kind of way) for spring and summer. So, if you're looking to add a few transitional pieces to your wardrobe, stocking up on this semi-confusing but definitely cute trend might not be such a bad idea. We realize knitwear probably isn't the first thing to come to mind when you think of warm weather outfits, and the reasons why are obvious. Cozy, oversized knit sweaters and cardigans definitely fall under autumn/winter staples, pairing seamlessly with PSLs and over-the-knee boots. However, these snuggly faves have cooler counterparts, and they're not to be overlooked for summer 2021. According to Tobi head stylist Joanna Angeles, it's kind of ironic to see this resurgence of knitwear in the new ""Roaring 20s"" of today, seeing as how the trend originally came into fashion circa the 1920s. ""There's this huge amalgamation of trends that we're experiencing in part due to nostalgia for pre-COVID times, but also in a way that's looking to embrace the bright, bold and free spirit of decades past,"" Angeles tells InStyle. Warm in nature, but cool in design, these knits act as transitional items for flip-flopping weather forecasts. They're also statement pieces that can highlight your individual style. For example, Angeles says she's seeing a lot of fun pieces pop up on the market, like crochet halter tops, matching knit cardigan sets with fun prints and patterns, and pops of color. These bolder looks can be paired with your favorite denim jeans or shorts, along with hoops and mules. RELATED: 14 Cute Summer Shoes That Shockingly Aren't Slippers ""Neutral knitwear can also be elevated by pairing with satin or faux-leather trousers and a kitten heel, and you can even throw a blazer over it for the office or a dinner date,"" Angeles adds. ""Last but not least, one of the most fun things I'm seeing right now is print/pattern mixing by pairing different colored or textured separates together."" Like Angeles, fashion influencers are also on board with the nostalgic trend's rebirth, and have been serving up plenty of inspiration on how to wear knitwear year-round. RELATED: So Many Top Models Are Dressing Like Ice Cream Cones Right Now Vibrantly colored knits make a statement on their own, so if you have a piece that pops, pair it with muted neutrals fo even more emphasis. Mixing and matching other bold hues with an already bold knit will just further emphasize your unique style. So if you like color and prints, don't shy away from combining them into one outfit (and that goes for any outfit — knit or not). RELATED: 7 Ways to Mix Prints Like a Pro If crop tops are your go-to for spring and summer anyway, why not switch things up from the traditional top and go for one of the knit variety? Pair the top with high waisted denim, or give the low-rise trend a try if you're feeling bold.  Slip into a pair of heels to elevate your look, or keep things casual with some Converse sneakers. Knits are casualwear, but that all changes when you pop on a blazer. Grab a pair of knit shorts, a coordinating T-shirt, and add a blazer over top for an easy, on-the-go, appropriate-for-everything look. You can dress up the outfit further with a pair of chunky boots or strappy heels, but if you're just running out to do some errands, a fresh pair of white sneakers will do. RELATED: 14 Blazer Outfit Ideas That Will Have You Saying 'Wait, Why Didn't I Think of That?' Just because they're shorts, doesn't mean they aren't cozy. Whether you're getting dressed for a weekend in, or changing from your work attire to something a little more comfortable, it doesn't get much more springtime snug than a pair of knit shorts with a basic tank or T-shirt. What's amazing about the knit resurgence is that clothing brands are designing them in every silhouette imaginable. A knit midi skirt is an exceptional piece to incorporate into your wardrobe staple because it's so versatile. Dress it up with a pretty blouse and heels for dinner, or dress it down with a cropped hoodie and clean sneakers for a grocery store run. Not sure how to style individual pieces of knitwear? Take out the guess work with a matching set. Comfy, classic, and easy to dress up or down with a change of accessories, plus, a monochromatic moment will never go out of style. One of the easiest ways to ease into the knitwear trend is to embrace the sweater vest trend. The styling options are endless: You could wear a cropped knit vest over a crisp button down or white t-shirt, tuck an oversized knit vest into high-waisted or biker shorts, or pair a neutral knit with color-popping accessories. Experiment with different looks and clothing combinations, and eventually you'll nail down your go-to style. RELATED: Shests Are the Comfortable Trend You'll Want to Try Before Fall Expect to see a lot of knit crop tops, knit shorts, and matching sets within the next few months.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather As we settle into hump day on week twelve(!) of the UK's Coronavirus-induced lockdown, it seems our shopping impulses have been switched back on somewhat. While the majority of us spent the first couple of months basking in tracksuits and appreciating the lack of reason to wear anything particularly groundbreaking, the more time that passes - and the more confusing the government's announcements get as to whether or not we're actually still in lockdown - the more we're aware that we will soon be required to put on actual clothes once again. We're also aware that we're in an entirely new season to the one we left behind at the beginning of lockdown, and therefore need to address the fact that the winter coat on the back of the door and chunky boots at the front of the wardrobe ought to be replaced by their fair-weather counterparts. Naturally, that welcomes a little bit of shopping - just to perfect our 2020 summer aesthetic. Because, trust us, after 3+ months with no one but our hallway mirror to show off our outfits to, the minute lockdown is lifted there'll be no stopping us when it comes to curating a #lewk. The good news? If you're trying to save your pennies right now - and let's face it, when are we not - one of our favourite high street stores has just launched a pretty major sale. Fans of & Other Stories, read on... Unsurprisingly - having earned themselves the unofficial title of the go-to high street store for epic dresses - there is a hugely impressive dress offering, from minis to maxis and everything in between (aka midis). From a navy, floral print midi at 51% off to a utility shirt reduced by 63% and Superga platform sneakers at 41% off, we're predicting several quick sell outs.

,30 Best Fashion Movies Of All Time (2022 Update),,https://thevou.com/fashion/best-fashion-movies/,Katherine Saxon,https://thevou.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Top-20-Best-Fashion-Movies-Of-All-Times-wtvox.com-00.jpg,,7 December 2021,https://thevou.com/author/kathe-saxon/,"This is a must-watch list of the 30 best fashion movies of all time for everyone interested in the world of fashion. A highly-curated selection of the top 30 best fashion movies of all time, with the aim of keeping you inspired, motivated, and most of all, entertained. You’ll discover how Anna made Vogue the iconic fashion magazine of today, the rise of McQueen, and the creative madness of Westwood. You’ll also brush up on some fashion history with the houses of Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Dior, and Coco Chanel. Without further ado, here we go with the top 30 best fashion movies of all time!   CRITICS SUMMARY “McQueen offers an intimate, well-sourced, and overall moving look at a young life and brilliant career that was tragically cut short.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on NETFLIX A personal look at the extraordinary life, career, and artistry of British fashion designer Alexander McQueen. McQueen, the designer, has started creating in his teens before getting noticed and working as a designer for Givenchy. Shortly after, he launched his own label, which continues to this day. Through exclusive interviews with his closest friends and family, recovered archives, exquisite visuals, and music, ‘McQueen‘ is an authentic celebration and thrilling portrait of an inspired yet tortured fashion visionary who took his own life in 2010. A must-see for all fashion lovers.  CRITICS SUMMARY “First Monday in May may not resonate far beyond its target demographic, but for fashion aficionados, it should prove utterly absorbing.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU ‘The First Monday in May‘ follows the creation of The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s most attended fashion exhibition in history: “China: Through The Looking Glass,” The exhibition was an exploration of Chinese-inspired Western fashions organized by MET’s Costume Institute curator, Andrew Bolton. With unprecedented access, filmmaker Andrew Rossi captures the collision of high fashion and celebrity at the Met Gala, at one of the biggest global fashion events chaired by the Vogue editor in chief, Anna Wintour. The documentary features a cast of renowned artists in many fields (including filmmaker Wong Kar Wai and fashion designers Karl Lagerfeld, Jean-Paul Gaultier, and John Galliano) as well as contemporary pop icons like Rihanna. The movie dives into the debate about whether fashion should be viewed as art.   CRITICS SUMMARY “A somewhat interesting documentary that brings you into the inner workings of a magazine, though if you are not a fashion junkie it is a bit hard to follow.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU As the editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris for 10 years, from 2001 to January 31, 2011, Carine Roitfeld has built a reputation as one of fashion’s most influential movers. Her inner circle of friends includes Versace, Tom Ford, Karl Lagerfeld, Mario Testino, Riccardo Tisci, Diane Von Furstenberg, and Alexander Wang. Yet few people outside the fashion world have heard of her…until now. ‘Mademoiselle C‘ chronicles Carine’s resignation from Conde Nast, and the launch of her new magazine ‘CR Fashion Book’. The movie gives a rare inside glimpse at the inner workings of Roitfeld’s professional world and personal life. It is a film about transition, letting the audience follow as Carine moves to New York, starts a new business, and prepares to become a grandmother. A movie filled with models, celebrities, and eccentric personalities that make the world of fashion so entertaining.  CRITICS SUMMARY “While it boasts its share of fine performances, Yves Saint Laurent is also disappointingly bland and formulaic; especially given its subject’s dazzling reputation.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU ‘Yves Saint Laurent’ is a French biographical drama based on the life of Yves Saint Laurent from 1958. The movie picks up with Saint Laurent as a 21-year-old nervy and tortured by self-doubt boy. It’s 1957 and he’s the new head designer of France’s biggest fashion house, Christian Dior. A couple of years later, he suffers a mental breakdown after being bullied about his sexuality and forced to fight in the Algerian war. As Saint Laurent battles coke addiction and depression, Pierre Bergé appears as a businessman, who becomes YSL bodyguard, business partner, and boyfriend. *To those of you interested in YSL, the 2010 ‘L’Amour Fou’, is another documentary I recommend you watch.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Valentino: The Last Emperor utilizes its access to the fashion icon to the fullest, and the result is a glitzy, dishy, and insightful documentary.” Watch on AMAZON Famed Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani opened his first fashion house in 1959. In 2007, Valentino announced his retirement plans and began preparing for his final show. This documentary follows Valentino during the last two years of his time as a designer, accompanied by Giancarlo Giammetti, his patient partner in both business and life. As Valentino gets ready to conclude his fashion career, he worries about ‘corporate intentions’ to buy his clothing line.  CRITICS SUMMARY “Ready to Wear is all appetizers: the main course never arrives. It seems like a very long wait to get to the various punch lines. Yet it is not unenjoyable!” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU ‘Prêt-à-Porter‘, released in the US as Ready to Wear, is a 1994 American satirical comedy-drama film. Co-written, directed, and produced by Robert Altman, the movie was shot on location, during the Paris Fashion Week. As models, designers and journalists gather for Paris Fashion Week, Fashion Council head Olivier de la Fontaine chokes to death on a sandwich. Olivier leaves behind a wife, a mistress, and a mysterious Russian companion who has fled the scene. As the death is being investigated, three rival magazine editors vie for the exclusive services of a trendy photographer while two journalists begin a hotel room tryst. The film features a host of international stars, models, and designers such as Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Kim Basinger, Lauren Bacall, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Lili Taylor, Anouk Aimée, and Sally Kellerman.   CRITICS SUMMARY “A rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel, this Devil is a witty expose of New York’s fashion scene, with Meryl Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Watch on HULU The naive, just-graduated in journalism, Andrea Sachs lands a job in New York as a second assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of ‘Runway’ fashion magazine. Miranda Priestly is a merciless executive; powerful, sophisticated, ruthless, and demanding, she’s unstoppable. Emily, the first assistant advises Andrea about the outrageous preferences and strange behavior of their cruel boss. At the same time, Nigel, a fashion stylist, helps Andrea to dress more adequately for the environment. In time, Andrea’s attitude and behavior begin to change, affecting her private life. At stake is her relationship with her boyfriend Nate, family, and friends. But, step by step, Andrea learns that life is made of choices.  CRITICS SUMMARY “Though it doesn’t quite capture the complexity of its subject’s life, Coco Avant Chanel remains a fascinating, appropriately lovely tribute.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Watch on NETFLIX Young Coco Chanel (Audrey Tautou) works as a seamstress by day and a cabaret entertainer by night. This is where Coco meets a wealthy heir (Benoît Poelvoorde), becomes his fashion consultant and lover. Tired of the flowery hats, tight corsets, and yards of lace that define women’s fashion, Coco uses her lover’s clothing as a starting point to distill an elegant and sophisticated line of women’s clothing that propels her to the top of Parisian haute couture. In a mixture of brutal candor and tender sympathy, ‘Coco Before Chanel’ charts the rise of an ambitious but difficult woman.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Dior and I will obviously appeal to fashion fans, but this beautifully tailored documentary may draw in even the least sartorially inclined.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU On the surface, Frédéric Tcheng’s documentary suggests an advertorial for the house of Dior (owned by the massive conglomerate LVMH). Intriguing quotes from legendary founder Christian Dior are deployed to paint Raf Simons, the new artistic director, as a worthy successor. The film is about Simons, an affable Belgian who befuddles the staff by asking to be called Raf, and his relationship with the Dior studio where the clothes are sewn by hand, down to the last bead. ‘Dior and I’ gives us a glimpse into the life of the seamstresses and cutters, artists in their own right. It is a deeply touching movie, showcasing a face of Dior from behind a curtain, just like the model that parades in a stunning dress and says, “I’m going to cry, it’s so beautiful.”  CRITICS SUMMARY “This documentary about the making of Vogue’s biggest issue and its frosty editor-in-chief is fascinating eye candy and light-on-its-feet fun.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU This excellent documentary by R J Cutler follows Anna Wintour, the renowned editor of ‘Vogue’, as she prepares to launch Vogue’s September 2007 issue. Weighing in at a record 840 pages, this edition is the magazine’s most important release, heralding the autumn fashions. With a trademark bob and omnipresent dark glasses, as she carefully supervises each page of the magazine, Wintour comes across as a successful woman that knows exactly what the readers want. The documentary has little to say about fashion and a lot about the ins and outs of media publishing and the workings of a magazine, through the lens of its notoriously demanding meanie-in-chief, Anna Wintour. See how Anna fights to maintain the brand she has brilliantly cultivated since taking over the editorial masthead in 1988.   CRITICS SUMMARY “The ugliness beneath the glamour is exposed by this vitally important documentary that will either induce you into changing your ways or simply have you curling into a fetal position from despair.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on NETFLIX Directed by Andrew Morgan, this unique documentary focuses on fast fashion. The director reveals several aspects of the garment industry from production, from the life of low-wage workers in developing countries to the after-effects such as river and soil pollution, pesticide contamination, disease and death. With an approach that looks at environmental, social and psychological aspects, Andrew examines consumerism and mass media, ultimately linking them to global capitalism. The documentary is a collage of several interviews with environmentalists, garment workers, factory owners, and people organizing fair trade companies or promoting sustainable clothing production.  CRITICS SUMMARY “Fresh Dressed offers an intelligent, entertaining overview of the fashion that helped define and spread a culture.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Watch on NETFLIX A fascinating chronicle of hip-hop, urban fashion, streetwear, the hustle that brought oversized pants and graffiti-drenched jackets from Orchard Street to high fashion catwalks and word’s shopping malls. Director Sacha Jenkins’ music-drenched history draws from a rich mix of archival materials and in-depth interviews with rappers, designers, and other industry insiders. The documentary is featuring many contemporary celebrities such as Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Sean “Puffy” Combs, Nas, Pusha T, Swizz Beatz, Damon Dash, Andre Leon Talley, A$AP Rocky, Marc Ecko, Big Daddy Kane, Kid ‘N Play & many others.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Suffused with happiness and modest charm, Bill Cunningham New York offers a touching, gently humorous portrait of its subject without invading his jealously guarded privacy.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Bill Cunningham, one of the mainstays of the New York Times, has been a contributor to the renowned newspaper for many decades. The documentary is an exhaustive profile of Bill Cunningham and his work. It includes interviews with friends, and often his subjects such as Tom Wolfe, David Rockefeller, and Vogue’s Anna Wintour. It also offers an in-depth look at the life of the eccentric chronicler of fashion, tirelessly snapping photos of and writing about interestingly attired celebrities or ordinary people he encounters on the street of New York.  CRITICS SUMMARY “An affectionate portrait created with visual flair, Diana Vreeland is entertaining, informative, and stylish, due in large part to its charismatic subject.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Watch on SLING TV ‘Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel‘ is an intimate portrait and a vibrant celebration of one of the most influential women of the 20th century, an enduring icon whose influence changed the face of fashion, beauty, art, publishing, and culture, forever. Diana Vreeland’s life is presented from her early days in Paris, to her work as a columnist and magazine editor, and to her role as a curator of a fashion museum. There is a lot to learn from the ex-editor-in-chief of Vogue, fashion editor of Harper’s Bazaar – where she worked for 25 years, and her remarkable stints at the Met’s Costume Institute where she helped popularise historical collections.   CRITICS SUMMARY “By turns dramatic and lighthearted, this documentary is as captivating as the fiercely independent woman it celebrates.” Watch on AMAZON A creation by Francesco Carrozzini, this is a chronicle of the life and times of his mother, Franca Sozzani, the editor of Italian Vogue and a fashion-world provocateur. From the legendary “Black Issue” and the “Plastic Surgery issue” Sozzani remains deeply committed to exploring subject matter off-limits to most in order to shake up the status quo and occasionally redefine the concept of beauty. With interviews from Karl Lagerfeld, Bruce Weber, Baz Luhrmann, Courtney Love, and many others, Carrozzini gives us a ‘behind the scenes’ view into his mother’s creative process as well as a peek into her vulnerabilities, both past, and present. Deeply insightful and often emotional this film is like a love letter from a son to his mother.  CRITICS SUMMARY “Westwood: Punk, Icon, Activist takes a thoroughly entertaining, albeit necessarily incomplete, look at the life and career of a British fashion pioneer.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Since igniting the punk movement with ex-partner and Sex Pistols’ manager Malcolm McLaren, Dame Vivienne Westwood has been redefining British fashion for over 40 years. Blending archival footage and insightful interviews, a unique portrait of Vivienne emerges and her fascinating network of collaborators. The documentary is taking viewers on Vivienne’s journey, from a childhood in postwar Derbyshire to the runways of Paris and Milan, and to the designer responsible for creating many of the most distinctive looks of our times.  CRITICS SUMMARY “A truly inspiring documentary diving into the life of the Belgian designer, Van Noten, who built a career working outside the fashion-industrial complex.” Watch on AMAZON A unique documentary exploring the intense passion and distinctive talent that make Dries Van Noten one of the most exquisite fashion designers in the world. For the first time ever, Dries Van Noten allows a filmmaker to accompany him in his creative process and rich home life, and his emblematic fashion shows that have become ‘cult-like events’ at the Parisian Fashion week. The precise steps taken by s Dries to conceive his collections, the choice for rich fabrics, embroidery, and printmaking were closely documented by Reiner Holzemer for an entire year. The result is an excellent film that offers an insight into the life, mind, and creative heart of a Master Fashion Designer who, for more than 25 years, has remained independent in a landscape of fashion consolidation and globalization.  CRITICS SUMMARY “The Gospel According to André offers an engaging overview of its fascinating subject, even if his accomplishments, and outsize personality, prove too expansive for a single film.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Watch on SLING TV Gospel According to André is Kate Novack’s intimate portrait of André Leon Talley, one of the most influential tastemakers and fashion curators of our times. The documentary takes the viewers on an emotional journey from André’s roots growing up in the segregated Jim Crow South to become a fixture in the world of fashion. Weaving together a wealth of archival footage from the most glamorous moments in fashion history with André’s poignant reflections on his life and career, ‘The Gospel According to André’ is a cinematic monument to one of the most unique figures of 20th Century American culture. Featuring commentary from fashion luminaries including Anna Wintour, Marc Jacobs, and Tom Ford, ‘The Gospel According to André’ is an indispensable addition to the growing canon of fashion documentaries.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Scatter My Ashes At Bergdorf’s is a fun documentary which ultimately doubles as an infomercial for the Manhattan store.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Bergdorf Goodman Inc. is a luxury department store located on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in New York City, and one of the most mythic all-American fashion emporiums. The place of many ultimate fashion fantasies, Bergdorf Goodmans’ iconic Manhattan department store is now part of the history of fashion. ‘Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf’s‘ grants the audience with a rarified chance to peek behind the store’s backroom doors. It is exclusive access to the fascinating inner workings and untold fabulous stories of Giorgio Armani, Candice Bergen, Manolo Blahnik, Isaac Mizrahi, and many other giants of fashion.  CRITICS SUMMARY “Unzipped displays the enchantment and prestige of the fashion world but simultaneously demystifies the artificial glam surrounding it.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU This behind-the-scenes documentary takes a lighthearted look at the fashion industry through the launch of New York City designer Isaac Mizrahi’s 1994 fall collection. The film explores how Mizrahi drew inspiration from Eskimos and ‘The Mary Tyler Moore Show’ to create his exclusive fashion line. The documentary also reveals the harried reality of mounting a major fashion show. Along the way, a number of bold-faced fashion icons and actors crop up, including John Galliano to Richard Gere.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Manolo will please fashion fans, though its size and scope may not be a perfect fit for all viewers.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Longtime fashion journalist Michael Roberts presents this never-before-seen peek into Manolo Blahnik, a legendary shoe designer. Manolo’s impeccable dedication to his craft set a fashion standard among celebrities, stylists, and industry icons. The documentary is featuring a ‘who’s who’ of the fashion and entertainment industries, including Anna Wintour, Rihanna, Paloma Picasso, Iman, Naomi Campbell, Rupert Everett, Karlie Kloss, André Leon Tally, and more.  CRITICS SUMMARY “Notebook on Cities and Clothes is on the point of cultural interaction, where the clothes are merely a pretext for an essay on the relationship between East and West, between originality and the endless reproduction.” Buy on AMAZON The prolific German documentary director Wim Wenders takes on the Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto as he prepares to create new designs for another season in Paris. The director investigates Yamamoto’s creative process, skill, dedication, philosophy and work, and ponders the relationship between cities, identity, and the cinema in the digital age of electronic data and computerized images.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Lagerfeld Confidential is more vanity project than documentary, revealing little of its evasive subject.” Buy on AMAZON This documentary profiles notoriously private fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. In his own words, Lagerfeld recounts his turbulent upbringing in Germany. Realizing at 13 that he was homosexual, Lagerfeld moved to Paris as a teenager to begin his fashion career. In between discussing his work and his views on matters from clothing to literature, Lagerfeld travels restlessly from his many homes to fashion shows and photoshoots, trailed by admirers like Nicole Kidman.  CRITICS SUMMARY “While haute couture may be an acquired appreciation, this documentary is specific in its focus – it is about Marc Jacobs and his creation process at Louis Vuitton. “ Watch on AMAZON From Japan to America, the LV logo dominates the fashion scene. But, behind Louis Vuitton’s creations is one man, the exceptional Marc Jacobs. With unprecedented access to one of the world’s hottest and busiest designers, the director offers an intimate and revealing portrait of the reclusive Marc Jacobs and the world of haute couture. Whether in the offices and workrooms of Paris and New York, the back of his car, or backstage at a fashion show, we see a genius at work. Jacobs endures unimaginable pressure to chart new paths in fashion as he straddles the demands of the Louis Vuitton conglomerate and his own Marc Jacobs label.   CRITICS SUMMARY “An exploration of the future of clothing, profiling forward-thinking companies who are at the forefront of redefining how and what we wear.” Watch on YOUTUBE Watch on VUDU ‘The Next Black’ is a pivotal conversation starter in the fashion industry. Following its premiere in 2014, the bubbling conversation around fashion sustainability has broken out of its niche confines and into mainstream consciousness. It’s an engaging visual introduction to the ways in which fashion is using technology and innovative fabrics to transform not just how clothes are produced, but the ways in which people wear them. Two years after its premiere, there have been huge strides, and even the most established brands are finally waking up to the commercial viability of technological solutions for eco-friendly design. However, while ‘The Next Black’ focuses on technology and the eventual digitisation of the fashion industry and what that will mean for everyday consumers, this documentary is more than a glamorous ode to the future of fashion. It’s a call to arms to think about fashion beyond the next five minutes – something both consumers and industry impresarios are guilty of.  CRITICS SUMMARY “The life and career of reclusive Belgian fashion designer Martin Margiela and his renegade catwalk.” Watch on YOUTUBE Martin Margiela is the most elusive figure in fashion. His work at his eponymous house, founded in 1989, is defined by his devotion to anonymity: both as a personal preference and as a creative theme, his legacy is immense and yet still shrouded in mystery. Alison Chernick’s 12-minute documentary traces Margiela’s career and aesthetic through interviews with an assortment of industry figures. From former boss Jean-Paul Gaultier to Vogue’s Suzy Menkes, the film offers a brilliant insight into the history of a man who changed and obscured the face of fashion.   CRITICS SUMMARY “The life and career of reclusive Belgian fashion designer Martin Margiela and his renegade catwalk.” Watch on HBO It might be hard to believe, but 2022 will mark the 130th birthday of Vogue magazine. When it first started, there were no photographs, just illustrations, and a focus on society women. After Condé Nast took over in 1909, things changed, with photography introduced and fashion becoming the focal point of the weekly. Of course, the publication eventually became a monthly paper riding the social tides and political changes, slowly becoming the magazine we know today. To commemorate the journey, directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato have put together ‘In Vogue: The Editor’s Eye’. A brief flip through the pages of the magazine’s editorial history, particularly the women whose influence and determination not only allowed the magazine to stay relevant but maintain its position at the forefront of its many competitors. Access the full documentary here.  CRITICS SUMMARY “A young model charts her rise from unknown to her picture’s placement on billboards and magazines, who has a breezy nature and openness in front of the camera,  which means we see her at her best and worst.” Watch on AMAZON Review revealing and engaging, ‘Picture Me’ is a raw and personal video diary of the charts model Sara Ziff. Follow Sara’s rise from a young fashion face to one adorned by billboards and fashion magazines from around the world. Ziff and filmmaker, Ole Schell, co-direct the documentary, which lifts the veil on the glamorous world of high fashion modeling from photo shoots with celebrated photographers to runway shows in New York, Milan, and Paris. The film depicts the ever-increasing demand for adolescent models, the pressure to stay thin, sexual harassment, and drug use. This intimate account features in-depth interviews with noted photographers and designers and showcases personal footage shot by the models themselves, giving voice to those who are often seen but rarely heard.   CRITICS SUMMARY “Colorful, witty, and uplifting, Advanced Style celebrates life and pays tribute to those who flout convention.” Watch on AMAZON Watch on VUDU Based on Ari Seth Cohen’s Advanced Style blog, this film charts the stylish lives and wardrobes of seven of New York’s most fabulous senior citizens. Proving that style is eternal, the older generation discusses their bursting wardrobes and the ways in which their attitudes to getting dressed have seen them go against the grain. As one of them puts it: ‘I never wanted to look young, I wanted to look great!’ Expect false eyelashes, lace ruffs and feather boas: none are off-limits. Official website and trailer here.  CRITICS SUMMARY “The documentary allows you to connect with McQueen not by excessively exploring his early life.” Watch on YOUTUBE This top 30 best fashion movies of all time must end how it has started, with the best fashion designer of all time, Lee Alexander McQueen. Fashion’s ‘enfant terrible’, McQueen defied convention and upset the fashion press with his designs: he dreamt up the infamous ‘bumster’ trousers and pairs of Armadillo heels made famous on the feet of Lady Gaga. Whereas Savage Beauty, the show which attracted hoards to the V&A, was primarily a celebration of his work, this Channel 4 documentary is a retrospective of his life, sadly cut short by suicide in 2011. Using archive footage and interviews from those closest to him, the documentary provides a deep insight into the unique genius of his transformative runway shows and the relentless pace and pressure of production. Beginning with his early years as a tailor on Savile Row, through his discovery by (and close friendship with) the equally eccentric Isabella Blow, and ending with him as one of the industry’s most innovative and troubled talents.  This highly curated list of the top 30 best fashion movies of all time is your fast track to the history of fashion and more. Moreover, if you’ve hit a creative plateau and don’t know what to do next, these movies will give you plenty of motivation to keep chasing your dreams. Hope you’ll enjoy watching them, at least as much as I’ve loved putting them together. Have fun! Celebrities, designers, and latest news in sustainable fashion.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Between flatforms, puffed up slides and chunky sandals there are quite a few bold shoe trends to choose from this summer. But for those who aren’t feeling such attention-grabbing styles, there’s a more low-key design that’s equally as popular right now: square toe sandals. Yup, the ‘90s silhouette is still going strong after a rise in square-toe pumps and boots pre-pandemic. Now, however they’re coming to us in the form of easy slides, strappy kitten heels and even sporty Teva-inspired designs. Here, 20 of the cutest pairs of square toe sandals to complete your summer wardrobe. RELATED: 30 of the Cutest Sundresses, from $18 to $425 These simple slides will go with everything in your wardrobe and cost just 30 bucks. Talk about a win-win situation. Buy it ($30) Just like Reformation’s clothing, these shoes are made using eco-friendly materials and methods. Buy it ($178) Another sustainable option, Alohas’ block heels are incredibly comfortable and come in three color options. Buy it ($158) Puffed up sandals and woven fisherman styles are both trending right now, but this design combines the best of both for one super-fun pop. Buy it ($298) OK, yes, that heel may look intimidating, but the fact that it is a thicker block combined with the lace-up front means these shoe are actually more comfortable than they appear. Buy it ($395) Add a touch of glam to your everyday ‘fits with these fun green slides complete with rhinestones galore. Buy it ($115) You can never go wrong with a simple metallic sandal. Buy it ($125) Chunky, strappy sandals are another hot summer trend, so why not combine it with square toes? Buy it ($84) Embrace the ‘90s vibes of square toes with a classic heeled mule. Even better if you wear it with a sleek shift dress a la Rachel Green. Buy it ($160) These cross-over sandals offer way more support than slinky flip flops without venturing all the way into thick, podiatrist-approved territory. Buy it ($120) We love the gorgeous blue-and-white print on these easy slides, plus you can even sport a matching top or dress to go with them. Buy it ($148) Ease your way back into wearing high heels with a simple kitten heel rather than your old favorite four-inch pumps. Buy it ($178) Upgrade your plain flip flops for a more detailed pair, like this cute double-strap style. Buy it ($45) If you like the idea of Birkenstock’s Arizona shoe but can’t seem to make it work for you, try this square-toe buckled sandal that’s a little sleeker and more fashion forward with a similar vibe. Buy it ($120) Mint, pistachio, seafoam—whatever you call this beautiful pale green hue, it’s been popping up everywhere we look recently, so why no hop aboard the train with some sleek mules? Buy it ($150) The ankle strap and double straps across the toes lend a ton of support to offset that super-slim stiletto heel. Buy it ($170) Wear these with everything from cut-off jeans to flirty sundresses to matching boxer sets. Buy it ($138) Bright white shoes are hot for summer, but they also require a lot of attention to keep them looking fresh and clean. Icy blue is just as fun, but shows wear a little less overtly. Buy it ($135; $68) These simple mules will see you through for years to come, even after square toes are replaced with the next hit footwear trend. Buy it ($119) These woven slides also come in neutral brown and classic black for those who don’t love mixing lots of patterns. Buy it ($98; $70) RELATED: 6 Hot New Fashion Brands to Know and Shop for Summer 2021 Enter your registered email below!",Trending Share 20 Pairs of Trendy Square Toe Sandals to Stock Up On for Summer  1.

Swimwear,'Basic swimwear' is this summer's hottest influencer trend,The rise of the print-less bikini.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/plain-swimwear-bikini-swimsuit,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61388fe69734ef64a15ee495/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/screen.jpg,,,," By Charlie Teather While 'basic' may well be one of the most cutting criticisms you can throw around right now, we're beginning to question whether it's actually all that bad to be basic. Who doesn't love a good cheese toastie, after all? Nude manicures will also forever be a favourite. And don't even get us started on peonies (swoooooon). So why the sudden urge to be anything but really b***** basic?! By Charlie Teather It's not just us fighting in this corner, either, with some of our favourite influencers also flying the #basic flag this summer. No, they're not 'gramming their new pink peony bouquets (even though we bet they've got a bunch full of them!), but rather their simple swimwear. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Yep. Forget prints and forget embellishment, this summer the swimsuit and bikini landscape is looking a whole lot simpler than recent seasons. And it is a VIBE let us tell you. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. We're not suggesting you forgo every element of zhush (God forbid!), but rather keep the creativity in the cuts and colour palette (peach, Bardot-sleeved cossie anyone?) and relish in the rise of the print-less bikini. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The magic is in the simplicity. Not only can you forget any worries as to whether your florals are too obvious, your sequins too garish, or your ironic emoji-embellishment misunderstood, but you can also wear it endlessly without people - you included - tiring of it. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. The beauty of statement-less swimwear is exactly that - that the smaller the obvious impact it has the easier it is to wear (and re-wear, and re-wear). And who doesn't want easy swimwear? This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. But don't get us wrong, statement-less, basic swimwear is nowhere near as dull as it sounds. It is, in fact, behind some of the very best beach looks. Understated, chic, elegant. Everything we've ever dreamed of looking like laying on that sand... Sign us up. Here is our pick of all the swimwear and bikinis you should be snapping up.

Books,An exposé of the dark underbelly of the fashion industry in an era of #TimesUp and #MeToo is guaranteed to be your summer read,A must-read.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/juno-dawson-meat-market-extract,Bianca London ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61388dae30654311017f637b/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gettyimages-699159973_sq.jpg,,,," By Bianca London **If you're looking for a good summer read to take on your next jaunt, we can certainly vouch for Juno Dawson's new tome, Meat Market. The book tells the tale of Jana Novak, who is catapulted to superstardom when she's scouted by a model agency. But the fashion industry is as grimy as it is glamorous, and there are predators at every turn. Honest and raw, this is a timely exposé of the dark underbelly of the fashion industry in an era of #TimesUp and #MeToo. It might just be Juno Dawson's most important book yet. Here, she shares an extract with GLAMOUR UK.** Why are men such trash? I’m pretty sure we’re being followed. I take another look over my shoulder, and, yes, sir, he’s still there. What a creep. I first noticed him when we come out the loos and he’s been lurking behind us all the way towards Stealth. Gross. Like, we’re blatantly on a school trip. Fuck is wrong with you? Skanky bastards, honestly. My phone vibrates in my back pocket. It’s Ferd. They’ve gone to Swarm instead of Stealth. ‘They’ve gone to get in the queue for Swarm,’ I tell Laurel. The others went on ahead of us while we went to the loo. Laurel has a bladder the size of a pea, I swear.Laurel nods. ‘OK . . .’ We change paths at Tidal Wave – giving it a wide berth so we don’t get soaked – and Laurel continues to babble on and on. I flick another look over my shoulder, pretending to play with my hair.What the actual fuck? The lurker has changed route too. OK. Little worried now. ‘. . . I mean,’ I try to focus on what Laurel’s saying, ‘why does she have to be so obvious? Like, I get it, she’s seeing Harrison now, but the way she’s always touching his hair and rubbing herself against him like a dog in heat. Has she never heard of dignity?’ I peek again. He’s still following us. Shit. He looks about thirty. Not old enough to be my father, but not far off. We turn down the path that leads right to the queue entrance. It’s supposed to look like an alien invasion: there’s a burning ambulance, police sirens and a charred phone box. It’s pretty cool but . . . ‘Jana, are you listening to––?’ ‘OK,’ I interrupt, pressing myself to her hip, ‘do not look back, but I think we’re being followed.’ ‘What?’ Of course, the first thing she does is turn right around.‘Laurel!’ She turns back. ‘Which one? The hipster guy?’ ‘Yes,’ I hiss. ‘Swear he’s been right behind us since we come out the loo.’ ‘Really? Ew! What a freak.’ This time, Laurel pretends to swish her waist-length hair off her face and sneaks another look. ‘OMG, Jana, he’s coming over.’ ‘What?’ ‘Hi there! Excuse me!’ he shouts. What fresh hell? ‘Keep walking,’ I say. Sometimes builders or whatever shout crap at us from off scaffolding and stuff, but I’ve never been actively followed before. Scary. You’d think you’d be safe at Thorpe-fucking-Park, right? ‘Sorry to bother you, can I just have a minute?’‘Let’s see what he wants. Maybe you dropped something.’‘Laurel, no . . .’ But it’s too late. He strides right up to us. ‘Crikey, you walk fast . . . I’ve been trying to catch up with you.’ He talks directly to me. ‘Hi, my name’s Tom Carney and I’m . . .’Swarm pelts by overhead and whatever he says is drowned out by the screams of the people on the ride. Ribbons of hair fly across my face. ‘What?’ I shout. ‘I asked how old you are.’ Laurel grimaces. ‘Too young for you, you skank.’ The man, Tom, smiles and slips a hand in his rucksack. He produces a business card and holds it in front of my face. *PRESTIGE MODELS Tom CarneyHead of Scouting* I blink. The ride soars by again and all I hear are screams while his lips silently move. ‘Sorry, what?’ ‘I said, have you ever done any modelling?’ he repeats. He don’t look like a paedo, although I figure only very unsuccessful ones do. He looks like a gay Shoreditch hipster: beanie hat, plastic glasses, lumberjack shirt and ginger beard. Bet he’s got a fold-out bike. ‘Seriously?’ Laurel says. ‘Jana?’ I ignore the tone in her voice. Shade. ‘No,’ I mumble. I hate my voice when I’m nervous; it goes so deep. I sound like a giant man. Hagrid realness. ‘Have you been approached by an agency before?’ ‘No.’ Man voice. Is he for real? A modelling agency? Hold up, is this a porn thing? Cos literally no one wants to see my flat arse in porn.‘Wow. That surprises me,’ Tom Carney says. ‘How old did you say you were?’ ‘I’m sixteen,’ I say. It’s a scorching, factor-fifty day in June. My thighs are sticky in denim cut-offs, and I’m wearing a Nirvana T-shirt and filthy Converse that ain’t been white for a long time. We’ve just finished our exams and school has brought us to Thorpe Park as a treat. The air is creamy with Hawaiian Tropic, candyfloss and hot dogs, mustard and ketchup. ‘Don’t tell him that,’ Laurel says, tugging on my hand. ‘He might be a paedo. We should find a teacher.’ ‘You’re absolutely right to be wary – there are fake scouts out there – but I swear this is legit. Prestige is one of London’s best model management agencies. You can call the office or visit the website. What’s your name?’ I know nothing about fashion and stuff, but I’ve heard of Prestige. They represent Clara Keys. We love Clara Keys. She’s our homegirl. ‘I’m Jana. Jana Novak.’ ‘That’s cute. Where are you from?’ ‘Battersea.’ My name always solicits that question. ‘But my parents are Serbian.’ ‘Awesome. Do you know how tall you are?’Too bloody tall. ‘I dunno,’ I say with a shrug. ‘Maybe five- eleven?’ I hope. I don’t want to be six-foot tall. I always hunch just in case. Another train car of screamers flies over. ‘Listen,’ Tom says,‘take my card – the number is on the back. No pressure but, if you want, talk to your parents and we’ll arrange a proper meeting at the office.’ Laurel sort of steps between us. ‘Are you for real, mate?’‘Hundred per cent. This is my job.’ He smiles and his teeth are like little Monopoly houses – too perfectly square to be real. ‘I know, right? I go to festivals and theme parks or anywhere where there are lots of teenagers to find new faces.’‘Cool job,’ Laurel says, eyes wide. ‘What about me? Do you think I could be a model?’ Oh, Laurel, hon, no. Awks. Playing along, Tom steps back to get a look at her. Laurel is much prettier than me. She’s got a little button nose and allergic-reaction lips that boys seem to bust a nut for. ‘What’s your name?’‘I’m Laurel Ross.’‘Well, Laurel, you’re definitely a very pretty girl. But how tall are you?’‘Five-five.’ Her voice drops. ‘But taller in heels!’He smiles sympathetically. ‘To be honest, we wouldn’t consider anyone shorter than five-eight.’‘Kate Moss is five-seven . . .’Tom smiles. ‘Kate Moss is Kate Moss.’‘Oh. OK.’‘But, Jana, I’d really love for you to give us a call. Seriously.’ Laurel’s face changes. Her mouth hangs open and shefrantically texts someone. I look to Tom. I shake my head. ‘Me? You sure?’ He grins. ‘Jana, frankly I’m amazed you haven’t been scouted before today. Get your parents to give me a call, yeah? Enjoy the rest of your day. Wear sunscreen.’ He walks away and gets sucked into a mass of Spanish tourists and I wonder if the whole thing was a weird hallucination. Country air, man. ‘Oh my god, Jana! Did that actually just happen?’ I guess if Laurel saw it too, it must have. She hops from foot to foot like she needs another pee.‘Quick! We have to go find Sabah and the others!’I shrug. I look at the glossy little card in my hand. My thumb traces the embossed letters. It feels expensive somehow, and I think about that chocolatey bastard Charlie and his golden ticket.

,"Pick a Favorite Shoulder, Because Asymmetrical Styles Are Everywhere for Spring '22",,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/one-shoulder-trend-spring-2022,,,,,,"Sometimes, looking at future fashion trends can feel like torture. Here we are, bracing ourselves for the freezing cold winter months, and at the same time, we're daydreaming about the light, airy dresses and tiny shorts making their way down the spring 2022 runways. Ugh. RELATED: Cropped Cardigans, Knee-High Socks, and 7 More '90s Trends That Will Be Big For Fall That's part of the reason why we were so excited to spot all the one-shoulder tops and dresses that are seemingly taking over next year. Sure, this asymmetrical look is one we enjoy wearing in the heat — it's cool, it's cute, and just sexy enough for outdoor dinner dates — but at the same time, there's no real reason why it won't work for fall, too, especially on transitional, in-between days. Of course, 'one-shoulder' might not even be the best way to describe what we're seeing for spring '22. These designs are different in the best way; some include a few extra, hole-punched cutouts, while others create an illusion, simply highlighting one side. Regardless, it seems like influencers are already on board. We saw plenty of single-shoulder styles on the street during Fashion Week, proving this detail is an investment to wear both now and later. With the help of those contrasting colors, this crisscross, cutout design immediately caught our eye. We'd wear this one on a tropical vacation, or even to a wedding. We just know someone, somewhere is going to show up at a major award show wearing this sleek sequined design. The side cutout adds some extra spice. RELATED: Celebrities Have Committed to 2021's Hole-Punched Trend Matching sets may be here to stay, but between that one-shoulder detail and eye-catching print, they'll feel fresh for spring '22. Dark, lacy, glam — we expect to see at least one It celebrity head to a dinner date night in this sexy number. And we guarantee we'll swoon all over again when we see it. If poufy sleeves are more your style, not to fret: the one-shoulder trend goes hand-in-hand with a whimsical aesthetic. Remember Gigi Hadid's runway tribute to baby Khai? She did it in a quirky, quilt-like dress — which yes, was a one-shouldered design. RELATED: Supermodels Are Already Wearing Fall's Biggest Trend With No Shirt Underneath This generation of single sexy shoulders doesn't play by the rules. For example, this Dundas X Revolve dress has a similar feel to one-sided styles, but is still covered up. We also spotted a handful of peek-a-boo shoulder cutouts, much like Monse's eye-catching — and super comfy-looking! — sweater dress. Asymmetrical pieces were definitely one of the themes of New York Fashion Week. While it may not be a traditional one-shoulder dress, this design drew our eyes to one side, while the top looked like an unfastened strap. Fun! Longer-sleeved options will take you through the colder months, but also work when things warm up again. Eloquii's One Shoulder Sweater Dress ($100) is easy enough to throw on in a pinch, while Kim Shui's balloon dress ($330) will add a bit of color — in a subtle way — to a neutral fall wardrobe. Ease yourself into this trend by simply trading tank tops and tees for one-shouldered styles. This Good American bodysuit ($115) will pair perfectly with your favorite jeans, while Zara's bright blue asymmetrical top ($20) is a low-effort statement piece. Borne Collection's black Limitless Dress ($48; Originally $68) is also a smart wear-anywhere staple that can be dressed up or down. Even if it's a tad too cold for bare arms, letting a one-shoulder something peek out from underneath a leather jacket or blazer is still just as fun. The addition of a cutout ensures this NBD top ($138) will always be the star of the show, and if you're looking for something with extra warmth, try a one-shouldered turtleneck, like this one from The Range ($195) or Cotton Citizen x Revolve's light pink option ($33; Originally $125).","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us Pick a Favorite Shoulder, Because Asymmetrical Styles Are Everywhere for Spring '22 PatBO Christian Siriano Victor Glemaud LaQuan Smith Ulla Johnson Moschino Dundas X Revolve Monse Sandy Liang Keep an Eye Out for One-Shouldered Dresses Switch Up Your Staples Incorporate Layers Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Summer isn’t over yet, which means you still have plenty of time to plan a much-deserved getaway to your destination of choice. (Mountains, beach, city, lake? We’re all for it.) But while relaxing with your family, friends or partner sounds totally blissful, the idea of packing for your trip—and looking stylish when you get there—can feel a little overwhelming. (Why do we all insist on bringing 10 pairs of underwear for a four-day trip?) To help alleviate packing panic, we asked stylish influencer, pro traveler and mom Krystalyn Laura to spill the deets on the best way to dress for a trip, plus her favorite on-trend essentials to bring—all of which you can pay for over time using Affirm. Affirm partners with thousands of brands and retailers and is super easy to use: All you have to do is shop, select Affirm as your payment option at checkout and see exactly what you owe up front, with no hidden fees or surprises. Plus, Affirm offers flexible payment options (monthly or every 2 weeks) that can be set up with autopay through the Affirm website or app. Ready to roll out that suitcase? Check out some of Krystalyn’s must-haves and follow along on her own summer vacation to Beverly Hills below. Krystalyn’s top advice is the simplest: “Always consider the weather.” Since you’ll probably want to take a dip no matter where you travel, a chic, comfortable bathing suit is a must. This one fulfills a few of summer’s trends: It’s a flattering black (high-waisted bottoms FTW!) and has a subtle metallic sheen. Because why not bring some bling to the beach? Buy Now: Oseree Lumière High-Waisted Bikini on Moda Operandi (as low as $25/mo with Affirm*) “I like to stick to neutrals no matter what the trend may be,” says Krystalyn, “So I’ll opt for shades such as beiges, white, and grays.” These off-white ergonomic slides are made of recycled material with a memory foam footbed for extra comfort. Plus, they’ll go with everything else in your suitcase. Buy Now: Parque Slide on Rag & Bone (4 interest-free payments of $57 with Affirm*) We consider leopard print a neutral. Not only is the pattern here to stay, this versatile sarong can be worn thrown over a bathing suit or as a skirt with a plain T-shirt or button-down for dinner. Plus, the blue print is surprisingly elegant. Buy Now: LA BLANCA Apulia Coverup Pareo on Neiman Marcus (4 interest-free payments of $23 with Affirm*) An everyday tote is essential for everyday life, but it also comes in handy wherever you’re traveling. After all, advises Kristalyn, you’ll need somewhere chic to stow everything from your beach read and sunscreen to your kids’ sand toys and snacks. A straw tote with a decorative floral scarf—like this one from Draper James (Reese Witherspoon’s brand!)—fits the bill. Buy Now: Draper James Everyday Tote on The Real Real (as low as $14/mo with Affirm*) No matter where you’re traveling this summer, you can’t go wrong with a relaxed pair of shorts that go with everything. Krystalyn throws a pair on over her swimsuit for a fast and fashionable outfit. The paperbag-waist on this pair is on-trend (not to mention forgiving on your midsection) and the light color and linen fabric will keep you cool. Buy Now: Posse Ducky Linen Shorts on Moda Operandi (as low as $19/mo with Affirm*) “I like to pack items that can be universal to whatever activity we’re doing,” says Krystalyn. What’s more universal than a casual, sun-blocking hat? This breathable version will add a stylish flair to any outfit and can be worn whether you’re at the beach or an amusement park. Buy Now: Loro Piana Straw Fedora Hat on The Real Real (as low as $64/mo with Affirm*) “For the mountains, we’ll bring athleisure outfits so we can go hiking and camping,” says Krystalyn. Whether or not you plan on being active, a cropped tank in a neutral color will look sleek with your leggings. (Or shorts and skirts if the most rigorous thing on your itinerary is a day of shopping.) Buy Now: Alo Yoga Cover Tank Top on Neiman Marcus (4 interest-free payments of $14 with Affirm*) Nothing screams summer like a crisp white sundress. We love this one for its floaty cotton fabric and delicately pleated skirt. Style yours over a swimsuit for a laid-back day at the beach or pair with flat lace-up sandals for dinner out on the town. Bonus: The brand is environmentally conscious. Buy Now: Three Graces London Aspen Cotton Midi Dress on Moda Operandi (as low as $67/mo with Affirm*) TikTok has spoken: ’90s fashion is here to stay. Spice up your life (and your hair) with this multicolored scrunchie made of upcycled vintage silk scarves. You’ll be adding a pop of color to your outfit and contributing to sustainable fashion at the same time. Win-win. Buy Now: Upcycled Silk Scrunchie on The Real Real (as low as $11/mo with Affirm*) Krystalyn loves a flirty pink minidress for a day of sightseeing or window shopping. The fit-and-flare silhouette on this one is super flattering, while the ruffles add a touch of bohemian whimsy. Go straight from day to night or slip it on for cocktails after an afternoon at the beach.Buy Now: LOVESHACKFANCY Natasha Ditsy Floral Mini Dress on Neiman Marcus (as low as $32/mo with Affirm*) A pair of old-school sneakers are your summer vacation secret weapon. Whether you’re at the airport, theme park or touring town, these two-tone trainers will look effortlessly cool. But no matter what you choose to pack, make sure it feels like you. “Always dress comfortably!,” says Kristalyn, “If it’s pops of color, all black, or even neutral shades, wear what makes you feel good.” Buy Now: Retro Runner Sneaker on Rag & Bone (4 interest free payments of $57 with Affirm*) *Your rate will be 0% APR or 10 to 30% APR based on credit and is subject to an eligibility check. For example, a $400 purchase might cost $34.00 per month over 12 months at 15% APR. Paid interest is non-refundable on returns.

Shopping,"Fashion editors are obsessed with this romantic, boho dress label this summer",We. Want. Everything.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/love-shack-fancy-dresses,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61388e93ba092ab636a10431/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/190217_lsf_shot26_3845_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather It's one of the most popular modern brands on Instagram right now, but for boho-inspired fashion label, LoveShackFancy, it is their vintage aesthetic from decades long ago that sees it stand out amidst a crowded market of mixed prints and fitted minis. A far cry from such punchy materials and shapes, LoveShack's USP is in its effortless silhouettes and fuss-free colourways. Launched in 2013, it was founder Rebecca Hessel Cohen's desire for unusual bridesmaids' dresses for her own wedding that ignited the now-well-loved label. Before officially launching the brand, Rebecca created a LoveShackFancy capsule collection with Gwyneth Paltrow for Goop, and can now count the likes of Gwyneth, Naomie Harris, Julia Restoin-Roitfeld and Arielle Charnas as huge fans of her brand. Having quickly evolved into a collection of fanciful silk dresses, the label now offers up a selection of ready-to-wear, accessories, swimwear and kidswear. And we want the lot. Even the kidswear, if we could. So what is her magic ingredient? Other than genuine authenticity (you don't get much more authentic than launching a fashion brand out of a need for such pieces rather than a desire to 'launch a fashion brand'), it's Rebecca's keen eye for whimsical detailing, effortless silhouettes and flattering layering that truly sells her clothes. That, and her knack for making you feel as though you're a romantic literary heroine from a Sunday night period drama. A super chic one. It's obvious how much Rebecca cares about her collections, travelling to London to snap up the most beautiful ribbons and button from low-key, undiscovered antique shops, and to Paris for beautiful vintage textiles and trims. Amongst a wealth of heavily patterned, lifeless pieces that drench our Instagram feeds daily, it's unsurprising that Rebecca's offering stands out.

,The Most Divisive Trend of the Summer Is This Tarzan-Like String Bikini Bottom,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/side-tie-string-bikini-bottom-trend,,,,,,"We've got to hand it to the people who design swimsuits - for such a small amount of material, they've really managed to spice things up this year, leaving us with a ton of trends to choose from. We've got our upside-down tops, shiny lurex materials, strappy, wrap-around options, and, of course, the ruffle-butt. But one look we're not totally sold on quite yet? The Tarzan-like, super cheeky (sometimes thong), string bikini bottom, which models and celebrities seem to be breaking out any time they're near a body of water. This side-tie style is fully adjustable, similar to triangle top, but the right way to wear it is by scrunching the whole thing to the middle, covering just the *essentials.* RELATED: Someone Alert Christina Aguilera, Because Twisted Halter-Neck Tops Are Trending Don't get us wrong - there's something equally sexy and cute about this design, which reminds us of swimsuits from the '90s and is right in line with all those throwback trends. But, they're just so incredibly tiny, and after seeing a TikTok video pointing out how they look like vintage period belts from the late 19th century, we simply can't unsee it. Yet, while these bottoms are no doubt one of the most divisive trends of the season - and clearly aren't the best option for those looking for full coverage, or anyone easily annoyed by constant adjusting - thanks to models and influencers, they're all over social media. And, like many questionable pieces of clothing, seeing it over and over again has us wondering if we should give it a try, too. After all, it does qualify as part of the chaotic bottom boom, and works for both vacation season and hot girl summer. Thankfully, since this extreme string bikini is so popular for 2021, there are plenty of options out there being sold in various vibrant colors, patterns, and sizes. So, if you're ready to hop on board and step out in this attention-grabbing yet controversial style, we've rounded up some great options at a variety of price points, ahead.

Fashion,These are all the winners from last night's Fashion Awards in London (you'll be hearing these names a lot in 2022!),It's the most major awards ceremony on the fashion calendar.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/fashion-awards-nominees-winners,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61a61a1fe64afe64b6482a81/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/FASHIONAWARDSWINNERS_11302021_GettyImages-1356256753_SQ.jpg,,,," By Charlie Teather As December nears, those of you with a keen eye on the ins and outs of the fashion world were no doubt wondering in what format the Fashion Awards would be returning this year. After taking last year's event online due to the pandemic's peak, last night finally saw the iconic ceremony celebrate a return to an IRL format as it kicked off at the Royal Albert Hall. Hosted by Billy Porter (yes, THE Billy Porter; the Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Award-winning actor, singer, and director) this year's Fashion Awards welcomed a seriously epic line-up on the red carpet, attracting the biggest names annually in fashion design, modelling, music and film. Following a momentous year of change and evolution, this year's Fashion Awards – presented by TikTok – expanded its global reach with a new creative approach and future-facing ambition, while also celebrating those who have had an important impact on the fashion industry in 2021. During the last eighteen months of digital experiences and socially-distanced catwalks which required a whole new sense of creativity, there has also been a renewed awareness of and enthusiasm for making positive change. In light of this, the Fashion Awards structure was reimagined to place fashion at the intersection of culture, and celebrated this year's leaders who are changing the industry for the better. Here is the full list of Fashion Award 2021 winners: This award recognises a British or international designer whose innovative collections have made a notable impact on the industry, defining the shape of global fashion. Recognises an emerging designer talent, who over the last 12 months has had a major creative impact on global fashion. By Charlie Teather Tommy Hilfiger was awarded for his outstanding contribution to the global fashion industry. Ib Kamara was honoured for his incredible contribution to culture, art, and fashion and his commitment to challenging stereotypes and the status quo. Alessandro Michele, Creative Director at Gucci, will be awarded the Trailblazer Award on Monday night. He is being honoured for his visionary work to date at the iconic label, continuing to expand the scope of what a traditional luxury fashion brand should be. Simone Rocha This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Dylan Jones The 2021 accolades included fifteen Leaders of Change; the designers, brands, creatives, and individuals who created positive change within the fashion industry this past year under three categories: Environment, People and Creativity.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. We’re getting to that point in winter when we’re just over boots and thick socks. And to be honest, we’re also getting pretty tired of our fluffy sandals and go-to house shoes. Luckily, it looks like we might actually be able to get outside a bit more this spring as members of our quarantine pods continue to get vaccinated. These six spring shoe trends will help you live your most stylish (and also comfortable) life, whether you’re strolling the halls of a museum, meeting friends for rooftop drinks or simply strutting around your living room. Now all you need is a fresh pedicure and you’ll be all set to hit the ground running...or walking, more likely. RELATED: 19 Lightweight Jackets and Coats We’re Living in This Spring Yep, everyone’s favorite ’70s-inspired Scandinavian shoe is back, baby, as proved by spring collections from the likes of Hermès, Sandy Liang and Stella McCartney. Wear these uber-comfy kicks with everything from high-waist mom jeans to tailored separates to nap dresses. And don’t be afraid to get funky with it, trying out bright colors or animal-inspired patterns, like Coterie member Jessie Loeffler Randall above. Shop similar styles: J.Crew ($178; $125); Dansko ($145); Swedish Hasbeens ($280); Loeffler Randall ($350) Whether it’s part of a slide, espadrille or mule, chain links—thick or thin—are a gorgeous way to add a touch of glam to any outfit. They could be over the front of some easy slides á la JW Anderson, draped around the ankle like Bottega Veneta or even as part of an ankle boot. Pro tip: If the links are on the chunkier side, stick to sleeker silhouettes, like silk slip dresses or classic tailoring to prevent your ’fit from looking too busy. Shop similar styles: Vince Camuto ($130; $52); ASOS ($64); Staud ($350); Stuart Weitzman ($595); JW Anderson ($640) The past few years have seen a resurgence of practical footwear, including the OG Velcro-strapped watershoe, Teva. Other brands have since released their own versions of the chunky sandal, including Chanel, Anna Sui and Boss. Keep the rest of your look light and breezy but learn toward dressier fabrics and luxe detailing, like Coterie member Monroe Steele’s sexy knit dress with a gold chain belt. ﻿Shop similar styles: Dr. Martens ($90); Loeffler Randall ($195); Vince ($250); Ancient Greek Sandals ($275); Chanel ($1,325) Think more along the lines of Onitsuka Tiger, rather than chunky ’90s styles. Folks are upgrading their WFH sweatsuits and thick-soled dad sneakers for more streamlined trackpants, sleek anoraks and sporty kicks with a vintage vibe. Lacoste and Gucci both showcased styles paired with oversize dresses in a multitude of colors (a look we absolutely stand by), but these styles will look equally good with some raw-hem cropped jeans and an oversize blouse for a more casual vibe. ﻿Shop similar styles: Onitsuka Tiger ($95); New Balance ($150); Rag & Bone ($225) This style is fab for a number of reasons: It has the polish and lift of other heeled sandals, with all the comfort of more casual iterations (ahem, flip-flops). We love how the models at Simone Rocha and Erdem wore flatforms with tiered floral maxi dresses. We’ll probably do the same from April through September. Shop similar styles: Franco Sarto ($60); ASOS ($64); Teva ($75); See by Chloé ($215); Prada ($750) We’re not going to lie to you, we have majorly mixed feelings about this trend. But we can’t deny that cushy thongs and kitten-heel flip flops were featured in multiple runway collections for spring/summer 2021, and many of our favorite influencers have already been spotted wearing them. To avoid looking too casual or like you just stepped out from a pedicure in your salon slides, look for styles with more structure or oomph to them by way of a luxe materials like leather and thicker soles or straps. Pair them with skirts or dresses rather than sweats, shorts or jeans to keep things elevated. Shop similar styles: UGG ($65); OluKai ($85); Rag & Bone ($195); K.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. When it comes to fashion trends, there are generally two types—those that are obnoxiously omnipresent and those that fly under the radar. The first camp announces itself loudly and is everywhere you turn. (looking at you Tie-dye.) You can’t decide if you love it, hate it or if you’re stuck in limbo because you just don’t want to wear the exact same thing as everyone else. As for the more subdued trends? They pop up in your feed, or you catch a glimpse of that cool girl at the train station. There’s a mystery there, and that’s enticing. One I’ve noticed gaining traction: The button-down shirt and boxer short set. And to be honest, I’m obsessed. Think: Tom Cruise a la Risky Business, but with a bit more uh, coverage. We’ve seen everyone from style influencers (like Pernille Teisbaek) to chic celebs (like Gabrielle Union) take on the look, ﻿and here are six iterations that deserve a spot in your wardrobe. RELATED: 5 Things Everyone in Brooklyn is Wearing Right Now   We first spotted this trend on YouTube star Keshia Rush, and ﻿there’s something about the ombre detail that makes it a winner in out book. The best part? It can be dressed all the way up with cool PVC mules and a clutch or pared down with classic high-top Converse sneakers for a casual coffee with your besties. Buy The Top ($325) Buy The Shorts ($250) Polo Ralph Lauren is the epitome of menswear chic so it makes sense that their take on this trend for women is spot on. We’re loving the classic logo detail, short sleeves and ultra-relaxed but structured look. Buy It ($111) This linen Everlane beauty takes the trend to new heights. Not only is this famously breathable fabric a lifesaver in hot weather, but it’s also more timeless than its striped pajama-esque brethren. Buy The Top ($58) Buy The Shorts ($38) Don’t mind us, we’re just solidifying this breezy ensemble as our go-to, no-fuss beach attire for all of summer 2021. We can hear the waves crashing just looking at this set. Buy The Top ($89) Buy The Shorts ($39) If you were trying to figure out how to bring sexy back, here’s the set for you. Throw on a cute bralette, or button the top up and tuck it, slide on some sultry heeled mules, a slinky purse and go live your best life out on the town (or in front of your Netflix). Buy The Top ($298) Buy The Shorts ($198) Look, there’s no denying that you look like you just rolled out of bed. We say, go with it.

Love Island,Searches for this summer trend are up 313% thanks to Love Island,Shine bright.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/neon-bikini-uk-trend,Oriana Findlay ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/613893173bf019dd15687428/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/imhannahwhiting_sf.jpg,,,," By Oriana Findlay As well as plenty of drama (we did not see that double dumping coming), Love Island has been serving up some serious fashion swimwear lewks. In the past week alone, eBay has recorded 1 search every 90 seconds for ‘Love Island’ on site, and 1 search every 3 seconds for clothing items featuring the word ‘Bev’ - one of the phrases coined by Islander, Lucie. But one of the most notable trends to come out of the villa so far is neon swimwear, with eBay seeing a 313% increase in searches for neon bikinis. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. In the first images of the Islanders, we saw Yewande, Amber and Amy all sporting neon bikinis. Since then we have seen a multitude of Islanders wearing neon wares on the show, including Molly-Mae who was single-handedly responsible for selling out THAT neon green snake print bikini. Luckily for anyone hoping to emulate their favourite islanders, there's no shortage of neon swimwear out there. Not one for the faint-hearted, vibrant zesty hues are back with a bang this year after endless seasons of the fashion pack drooling over all things pastel - and the high street is serving up every single incarnation of the hue. The vibrant colour has also been championed by every single Kardashian, as well as celebrities and influencers alike at festivals like Coachella. Shine bright.

,"I'm a Fashion Editor, and These Are the 17 Spring Dresses in My Cart Right Now",,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/spring-dresses,,,,,,"Very few things make me feel as happy as the year's first round of warm, sunny days. Finally, finally I can stop wearing tons of layers and let my legs be free — preferably while walking around my neighborhood in colorful, printed spring dresses. Now that the world is on its way to getting vaccinated, I'm more excited about getting dressed than I have been in over a year, and admittedly can't stop browsing for clothes I might wear for future made-up occasions. I have a spring birthday, so I want something poufy to celebrate in (even if it's for a small park hang), and I'm also feeling the whole '00s comeback, meaning a tight, strappy mini is a must. RELATED: The Pully Top Is the New Strange Fashion Trend Celebrities Can't Stop Wearing My spring dress shopping list seems to grow by the day, but since I can't realistically buy everything I'm lusting after (without going into debt, that is), I might as well share my picks with some other fashion lovers, so we can benefit. Some of these designs are bold and whimsical, while others are subtle and sexy. There are a few meant for cooler days, with longer sleeves and sweater material, while a handful will work for that random spike in temperature, or can easily be layered over a button-down or T-shirt. Still, each and every dress is super cute in its own way, and you'll want to scoop one (or two!) up before they sell out.

Then, there was the year 2015, when the Met Gala saw not one nor two but three naked dresses on the red carpet, all worn by Hollywood’s hottest A-listers. Jennifer Lopez, above, bared her famous curves in a custom Atelier Versace illusion gown. Beyoncé was nearly naked in Givenchy.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather Is it just us or has this week's partial easing of restrictions in England and Wales been a little overwhelming? Whether it's the excitement of pubs and restaurants reopening, the relentless swarm of social interaction being plastered across social media or the pressure to pick the right haircut during that long-awaited salon appointment, after a year spent confined to our sofas it's no surprise that even a smidge of 'real life' feels like a lot. If you've spend the last twelve months in nothing but your favourite loungewear and matching tracksuits then your reemergence into society also no doubt brings about a touch of wardrobe fear. Are we all sticking to the comfies now? Are we going entirely the other way and wearing six-inch heels to lunch? If you're looking to spruce up your post-lockdown look without breaking the bank - because, let's face it, we're saving those hard earned pennies for another round/an extra desert now that we finally don't have to pour/cook for ourselves - then it's a good idea to head for the spring sales which are just getting started. And if you're looking to avoid anything else that might overwhelm you, you'd be wise to keep reading... Sale season can often feel like a bit of a chaotic free-for-all where you rush and grab anything with a good discount without even contemplating its viability in your personal wardrobe. You don't have time to consider your purchase because someone is always right behind you - be it figuratively online with their 'back in stock' notifications switched on in preparation for the minute you put it down, or literally now that stores have reopened. Take H&M, for example. If you head to the brand's sale section on the website you're confronted with 3,807 discounted items to trawl through, which is enough to intimidate even the savviest shopper. Luckily for you we like a challenge, and have scrolled through every item on the hunt for the real gems.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. As the saying goes, hell hath no fury like a shopper scorned. OK, so we may have taken some creative liberty with that phrase, but it’s a theory that’s never been more true than in 2021 because we’re about to enter the era of “revenge shopping.” What’s that, you ask? According to Rakuten, “Once the pandemic comes to a close, consumers will go out and do lots of shopping after being stuck inside for so long.” But that doesn’t mean we’ll be buying our 1,001st sweatsuit or an air fryer. Oh no, shoppers will be going after the items they had little to no use for under stay-at-home orders that left them dining, entertaining and “virtually” traveling from their kitchen table/bed/couch. Kristen Gall, president of Rakuten adds: “The advent of revenge shopping will resemble what we saw during the Roaring Twenties—a surging economy that will drive people to shop for more of the finer things that many felt they were deprived of due to the pandemic. This last year also acted like a giant savings account for many people, which means they now actually have the means to treat themselves.” So yeah, spring and summer 2021 will be a huge time for buying luxury handbags and shoes that you can finally show off at a fancy dinner. And to that, we say: Bring on the purchases. Here, 15 fashion items you should absolutely have on your “revenge shopping” list. RELATED: 22 Cute Summer Dresses Under $170 to Buy Now and Wear on Repeat You haven’t had the need to buy a new work bag in ages...but now that your office is opening back up again, you’ll want to treat your laptop to a fancy new carrying case made from Italian leather. The best part about this sleek Bee & Kin style? That front pocket holds a wireless charger for your phone, so you’ll never run out of juice when you reenter the real world. BUY IT ($395) They’re pool slides. They’re happy hour shoes. They’ll look great on Instagram. Whatever way you need to justify it, these rubber Gucci slides will be a playful way to step into summer. BUY IT ($350) Admit it: Your legging collection has seriously increased in size during the past few months. Now, it’s time to make sure your jean drawer catches up. These light wash Levi’s will definitely get you through spring and summer—and look so cute with brown leather boots come fall. BUY IT ($98) Available in sizes 24 to 32 Hello, brand new Ray-Ban silhouette. These angular cuties will provide just the edge you need to put a fresh spin on the spring and summer dresses you bought last March and never got the chance to wear. BUY IT ($215) If it sparks joy, you should totally get it. And this colorblocked midi dress is trendy but not too dressy. Which means you’ll be able to wear it to lunch with the girls followed by shopping at your go-to local boutiques. BUY IT ($325) Available in sizes XS to XL No, it’s not crazy to buy a necklace with the explicit purpose of wearing it with a bikini on vacation. In fact, we absolutely condone such behavior. BUY IT ($125) We have a feeling you’ll reach for this clutch for daytime and nighttime events. You’ll never be so happy to have 15 wedding invites arrive within one week. Bring. It. On. BUY IT ($295) Because the slip dress trend isn’t fading anytime soon and you don’t own a pale, silk blue one that you can wear to half of those aforementioned 15 weddings. BUY IT ($199) Available in sizes XS to XL This whimsical Sophie Buhai creation feels like something plucked from our childhood but updated for our adult taste, thanks to those stunning lapis stones. Plus, it’ll look so cool with a simple T-shirt or tank. BUY IT ($543) Introduce your jeans to their new best friend: A dressy (but still super comfortable) jacket. They’ll be overjoyed not to be paired with a hoodie—although we fully support you wearing this tweedy number with your favorite faded T-shirt. BUY IT ($365) Available in sizes XS to XXL Your revenge shopping spree doesn’t have to be chock full of items that you’ll only wear on special occasions. In fact, we think you’ll slip on these sole-friendly sandals most days this summer, since they pair just as well with denim shorts as they do a mini floral dress. And they can handle a few miles of walking, in case you find yourself out for a serious stroll. BUY IT ($168) Go ahead and acquire a whole new wardrobe of bathing suits. You might wear them to soak up some rays from the front lawn or to glamorously lounge by the shore—but either way, you won’t regret adding this simple-but-flattering Good American number to your collection. BUY IT ($95) Available in sizes XS to XXXL You’re obviously going to need a chic coverup to go with said bikini and one-piece wardrobe. And this pink number is bound to rack up compliments wherever you wear it. BUY IT ($371) Available in sizes XS to XL You read that right: This beach-ready hat is packable. Which means it won’t get ruined if you toss it in a suitcase or even a duffle bag. It’s one way to ensure you’ll have a stress-free weekend…or at least one without any fashion emergencies. BUY IT ($195) If you’re looking for a keepsake that best represents this time, you can’t beat a ladylike handbag done up in summer rattan and topped off with a luxe gold closure.

,The Summer-3 Fashion Rule Is the Easy Yet Smart Outfit Trick You Have to Try,,https://www.instyle.com/fashion/clothing/the-summer-3-fashion-rule-is-the-seasons-best-outfit-idea,,,,,,"In many ways, everything seems to be happening all at once — we're socializing again, heading back to the office, finally going on vacation, and trying to dress for the heat. And, while we've definitely seen an uptick in playful fashion choices (it's time to break out those chaotic bottoms and '00s-inspired tops!), we've still found ourselves experiencing the same old dilemma when picking out an outfit. What's something easy that works for all the events on our list? That we can throw together in a flash, without too much fuss? Well, that's when it's time to break out the Summer-3 rule. This classic trick is key for finding an impressive, cute outfit that you can wear to both an in-person meeting (!!!) and drinks with your friends. RELATED: 10 Cute Summer Outfit Ideas to Wear All Season Long All you need are three key items in order to nail this fashion formula: a dress of your choice, statement earrings, and a pair of sandals. That's it! It's the season's easiest, no-brainer outfit idea, and it works every single time, especially since you can quickly switch out certain styles in order to make it more formal or casual. Ahead, we're rounding up photographic proof that the Summer-3 is a favorite among well-dressed women, and that despite its simplicity, it's far from boring. RELATED: 11 Beach Outfit Ideas We're So Excited to Wear This Summer With a fun dress as the focus, you won't have to overthink the other two items. A pair of gold hoops and some strappy sandals will be more than enough. A solid colored design, paired with a bold pair of earrings and simple shoes, will always look sleek. If your dress is somewhat simple, throw on a pair of heels to add some spice. Sure, Gothcore is having a moment, but if you're feeling the urge to dress a bit more whimsical, go ahead and pile on all the colors. Style a bright, printed dress with a vibrant pair of earrings to ensure your outfit stands out from the pack. RELATED: 20 Eye-Catching Color Combinations to Wear Right Now Slides are for sure a summer staple, so if you're looking for a sandal that will go with every outfit — including your best dress — invest in a neutral pair. They don't have to be fancy; even a pair of Birkenstocks are surprisingly versatile. Despite the season's steamy reputation, there are days and nights when the weather is a tad chilly. Not to worry, though: the Summer-3 rule works with breezy, long-sleeved styles, too. RELATED: 13 Fall Dress Trends That Actually Work For Summer, Too Platforms, metallics, lace-up straps, embellishments — footwear that features these tiny but powerful details will give your sweet floral dress and drop earring combo a fashion-forward boost. If you still feel your outfit is missing a little something, simply add a belt. Whether it's a wrap-around option, leather, or a chain style, it will accentuate your waist and give your look some flair.","Top Navigation Profile Menu Account More Account More Explore InStyle Explore Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty The Most Surprising Snubs From the 2022 Oscar Nominations Peloton's Tunde Oyeneyin on the Secret to Sweat-Proof Makeup and How Representation Can Change Your Life Fashion This Easy Guide Is the Trick to Finding Your Signature Fashion Color Celebrity The 39 Most Naked Dresses of All Time Beauty Hell Yeah, Grunge Makeup Is Back — Here Are 8 Looks to Get You Inspired Hair 14 Androgynous Haircuts You'll Want to Take Straight to Your Stylist Lifestyle The Most Compatible — and Most Problematic — Zodiac Signs for a Pisces Politics & Social Issues 50 Badass Change Makers Pop Culture Introducing InStyle's First Podcast: Ladies First with Laura Brown Shopping The 17 Best Shapewear Pieces You'll Actually Want to Wear Profile Menu Account More Account More Follow Us The Summer-3 Fashion Rule Is the Easy Yet Smart Outfit Trick You Have to Try Reach for Puff Sleeves or Ruffles Try a Maxi Make It Bright Remember the Essentials Try Long Sleeves Play Around With Your Shoes Add an Extra Step Share & More Magazines & More Learn More Connect View image","Explore InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Close  Join Now     Join Now this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab My Account     My Account this link opens in a new tab this link opens in a new tab Login Subscribe Pin Pin FB FB Close this dialog window InStyle InStyle InStyle InStyle  Explore   Bold Makeup on Clean Skin Is the Next Wave in Beauty Why be subtle when you can be spectacular?

,Dark Academia Fashion EXPLAINED In 2022 (+ 30 Brands & Aesthetic Outfits),,https://thevou.com/fashion/dark-academia-fashion/,Katherine Saxon,https://thevou.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dark-Academia-Fashion-wtvox.com-00.jpg,,13 January 2021,https://thevou.com/author/kathe-saxon/,"Dark Academia fashion is one of the trendiest topics right now. Right now, there are over 160,000 #darkacademia posts on Instagram, and over a million posts on Tumblr. The topic is growing fast on Reddit as well. However, the most significant wave of interest comes from the ‘TikTok generation’, with almost 25 million views to date.  So if you’re interested to know more about Dark Academia fashion and the best places to shop for Dark Academia plus size clothing, this article is for you. Dark academia refers to a new aesthetic style that draws inspiration from the classic Greek arts, writing, architecture, deeply infused with Gothic elements and concepts of death. Dark academia fashion style is designed to reflect a subculture that emphasizes education, learning, reading, writing, and hence the ‘academic’ touch.   However, what makes Dark Academia fashion look so distinct from the classic academic fashion style is the ‘dark’, gothic aesthetic influence. To best picture the ‘dark academia fashion’, imagine someone wearing a pair of vintage tweed pants. Add to that image a slubby thick yarn cardigan and a worn satchel, packed with academic papers and books. The Dark Academic fashion style is filled with nostalgic vibes. That is because the Dark Academia subculture aims to recreate the vibes of the 19th century of private English boarding schools and Ivy League colleges in New England.  Right now, the Dark Academia fashion aesthetic draws a lot from the Greek culture and arts, but also from the Harry Potter films. Dark Academia aesthetic, in particular, is popular with teenagers, posting on social media pictures of the Harry Potter series made wool sweaters, rich textures cardigans, chocolate brown pants, or even dark academia room aesthetic decors.  To fashion critics, the Dark Academia aesthetic is similar to the classic preppy style. Preppy became famous for its chinos, argyle, and crewneck sweaters. Yet, Dark Academia fashion is more Autumn-Esque, with duller and darker color palettes. Given its apparent heavy and Gothic constructs, just like goth clothing brands, Dark Academia fashion is not that suitable for countries with long summers and hot weather all year round.  Some of the most popular Dark Academia styles right now are built on three core things: First, the garments you put together must be vintage, from thrift stores, or online websites selling secondhand fashion, with a gothic vibe.  Second, the overall style must augment the intellectual look. For that, try to complement the leather-bound books, handwritten notes, and rolled maps coming out of your handbag. Third, each popular Dark Academia style relies on some of the staples I enumerate below.  Choose blouses that have cuffed sleeves – it helps to create that extra touch of British heritage. You should also choose blouses with large bell sleeves, to achieve that unique academic look. For a more sophisticated Dark Academia look, go for tops that you can button up. I personally wear a lot of versatile wrap tops made of silk. Not only silk is super cool and breathable in the summertime, but distressed silk tops confer me with a rebellious, unique style.  For a super stylish and refined Dark Academia look I recommend you to go for long skirts. Easier and more comfortable when compared to trousers. Also, if you live in a hot country, long skirts are preferable to trousers. Why? Because skirts protect your legs from the sun while allowing ventilation at the same time. However, if you decide to wear trousers, remember that wool-blends and corduroy materials are best for this style. I also wear trousers and I often cut them at the ankle height for an extra bit of a nonconformist look. But, if you don’t know how to cut and sew back trousers, cuff them up to create that kind of sailor, tapered look.   Remember the glorified tweed blazer of the 50s? The tweed blazer is by far the best outerwear for the Dark Academia look. Just make sure you put it over your shoulders, without the sleeves on. The tweed blazer also goes great with dark straight-leg women’s jeans.  When it comes to which shoes are best for the Dark Academia look, the opinions are split. Some prefer open shoes, just like the ancient Romans and Greeks. Others argue that there are no sandals in Harry Potter movies and insist on boots and low chunky heels. Personally, I prefer boots as it allows me to emphasize on the Gothic look that I love so much. Yet, regardless of what shoes you choose, make sure you do not match flip-flops with the Dark Academia style. Seriously, don’t ever do that!   A perfect example of a dark Academia summer outfit is a white t-shirt with oversized check linen blazer and brogue lace-ups. Dark Academia clothes are great for cities with a colder climate. Nevertheless, some of you insist on wearing this style in the summer as well. If that’s your case, there are some ways around as I’m going to explain below: To start with, you must pick only all-natural fabrics. Avoid polyester and plastic blends at all costs. Compared to blends, natural fibers absorb moisture fast. Especially if you sweat a lot, these organic fabrics will let your body ventilate with ease. From all-natural fibers, these are the top 4 you should wear:  This spring saw schools from all over the world come to a halt. There aren’t any more classes or studies abroad. There are no more graduations, proms, or fashion show-offs. Moreover, what’s going to happen in September remains somehow unknown. However, teenagers missing school – because of the Coronavirus lockdown –  have chosen a style that keeps them somehow connected. True, the concept of Dark Academia fashion precedes the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it was during the lockdown, when the 14 to 24 years old have started to flood social media platforms with school-like outfits.  And, the gloomy feel of COVID-19 brought the Gothic vibe out, and people started to tag pics with the ‘Dark Academia’ moniker. However, the Dark Academia subculture is most popular amongst three groups in particular: The idea behind any Dark Academia style is to construct a look that’s reflecting and accentuating your ‘cultural self’. Rocking this style does not require you to have a countryside mansion with a big kitchen for baking and a field of flowers. In fact, some of the best representatives of the Dark Academia style are students such as Laura Piszczatowska, a history graduate from Norway. “My favourite academia outfits consists of tweed pants, black turtlenecks, elegant boots, and long thrift coats,” she said. Laura also runs ‘Geminnorum’, a Dark Academia Instagram account with over 28,000 followers.  “Dark Academia fashion styles suit the LGBTQ+ community as well“, says Evelyn Meyer, a supporter of Dark Academia male looks and creator of ‘Dark Academia Check Sound’. Evelyn’s views are reinforced by Dilara Scholz, a researcher in fashion history at Royal Holloway, University of London: “Androgynous vintage blazers are representative for the Dark Academia aesthetic,” said Dilara Dilara considers herself an adherent of the Dark Academia subculture. “Most Dark Academia silhouettes remind of the 1940s men’s look. It is a style that can be worn by anyone who does not fit into any gender definition,” she completes. The success of the style with the LGBTQ+ community is, in part, credited to books that feature LGBTQ+ characters, such as ‘If We Were Villains‘ by M.L. Rio and ‘Kill Your Darlings‘ by Allen Ginsberg. “A good part of Dark Academia is aesthetics. But, the more you explore the styles, the more you connect to other people like you. The main point here is a common desire to learn,” said Declan Lyman, 15, who posts Dark Academia videos on TikTok. Even though it’s about classics and styles, Dark Academia is a very open community,” said Lucien K, 21, who posts about Dark Academia styles on TikToks, or about himself reading books and doing makeups. “It’s also about breaking stereotypes regardless of gender or sexuality.”  To date, the Dark Academia subculture has shown the same openness towards plus-size people. “I was afraid to wear anything that would accentuate my body shapes and weight. However, after falling in love with the style I’ve realised that if I wear clothes that make me feel happy and confident, any fear goes away,” told us Helen Belfort, a student at the University of Oxford, UK. However, it still remains difficult to find suitable dark academia outfits for plus size. And, just like Helen, I am also falling into this category. In the past, I’ve tried to find complete Dark Academia outfits. It was so hard. In fact, my struggle to find suitable garments is one of the main reasons I am writing and sharing this article with you. In time I’ve discovered that it is much easier to buy individual pieces rather than whole outfits. Moreover, I love the process of creating my special looks as I put the parts together, one by one. Here are the best places to shop Dark Academia plus size right now: Other similar aesthetics are Light Academia and Cottagecore, which are taking over the internet, in particular, TikTok and Instagram in 2021. Celebrities, designers, and latest news in sustainable fashion.  What is your favorite Dark Academia clothing brand? What are your favorite Dark Academia summer outfits? What is the biggest problem you’ve faced when choosing the Dark Academia style? Is there any other similar style you would like us to cover? Would love to hear your thought and comments below! Softcore for me. I think most of the outfits in these pictures are just preppy or just too mainstream. Where’s the hardcore dark academia, with gothic s..it and stuff? I’m a guy (24), but since the available articles on fashion – and especially subculture fashion like this – are very sparse, I rely on sources like this. And, am very thankful for them! (I am actually writing a bachelor thesis on “the Edwardian fashion in current popular culture”, so to me, reading this article is TECHNICALLY my schoolwork, lol) I personally love my waistcoats, I have 2 from thrift stores and one from my grandfather (talk about true vintage!), also double-breasted blazers, and TWEED FOREVER! I can HEAVILY relate to the trouble with summer, even before dressing like this I hated summer, nowadays it’s a nightmare. I personally try to solve it by wearing 100% linen stuff. It lacks the gothic vibe, but at least you don’t sweat so much. Good luck to everyone, especially during these tough times! Hey, any chance you’re done your thesis by now? I’d love to give it a read if that’s possible! Sounds like a super interesting topic! This was a very interesting read. For summer, I found that the (minimalistic) Mediterranean/Provençal fashion style fits well with Dark Academia. Think: (off-)white linen shirts, blouses, and dresses. Brown leather shoes, sandals, and heels. Brown leather handbags or a woven straw bag. A dark linen pants, sand colored trousers, and straw hats, etc. It also fits thematically because for one it draws further on the classical, Greek influences, and two because in Art History I’ve learned that a lot of great artists moved or traveled to the South of France for various reasons. There was even a moment in British history where the people were sort of cut off from mainland Europe and because they couldn’t travel to France anymore they started to go on vacation to the south of the UK. Apparently, there is a place there that sort of looks Mediterranean and people could pretend they were in France. Anyway, I’m getting off-topic… The Provençal style also uses a lot of natural fabrics like linen, silk organic cotton, and wool. So you can have pieces in your wardrobe that works for both seasons. I recommend looking on Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration for this summer style. That’s how I found out about it. PS: English isn’t my first language so I apologize for any spelling mistakes. Putting on checkered pants and a shint doesn’t mean its dark academia. I’ll politely tell you to stop.Ps. Not gatekeeping, this is embarrassing and a bad look for the actual genre. I couldnt find the “Geminnorum” instagram account you have mentioned… could someone please send me a link ?! Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

Shopping,The 'bra accentuation trend' is the racy look to embrace this spring,The season just got racier.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/bra-accentuation-trend-ss20,Sophie Cockett ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61389b3d54a5dc97887e8676/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gettyimages-1175094047_sq_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Sophie Cockett In 2019, we grew tired of concealing our lace bras underneath oversized t-shirts and slip dresses. Instead, we became obsessed showing them off. We wore underwear as outerwear like there was no tomorrow and obsessed over pretty bralettes. It was music to our ears when we realised that, this summer, we’ll be doing something largely similar. The “underwear as outerwear” trend might have had a slightly classier update, but we’re set to draw attention there when the sun starts to shine, no less. The bra accentuation trend is here to stay, and detailing around the brassiere is about to make every outfit a whole lot more feminine. The most obvious way to rock the trend is by donning a bralette or bandeau, obviously. That said, the best thing about this trend is that you can rock it without bearing it all. It’s not so much a case of 'wear your bra with a blazer and hope for the best', rather a tendency to reach towards sequin accentuation, vest tops with exposed cup detailing or stitching which mimics the effect of a bra. Things are racy without being over-exposed, so believe it or not, the trend can be rocked in the day. Some of the bra accentuation trend pieces on the high street this season are killer, with ASOS and & Other Stories leading the way. Head to the latter if it’s a pretty bralette or velvet bandeau you’re after, or make a beeline for ASOS if you want a stitched-detailed top. They even dropped a sheer mesh blouse (which is now in the sale, FYI, and also ticks the sheer layering trend off of your must-try list), which we’re seriously obsessing over. Keep scrolling.

Aside from those that you follow on Instagram, how often do you take a look at what's being worn, championed or spoken about by some of the other big names on social platforms? The answer is likely hardly ever. But while there is, of course, something to be said for personal preference and 'liking what you like', giving yourself access to a broader array of sartorial inspiration - outside of the influencers that you already follow - can introduce a wealth of new styles, brands and trends that you might otherwise have not been privy to. We all need a bit of escapism right now. By Charlie Teather We caught up with global designer fashion e-tailer Net-A-Porter to discover which pieces are proving to be summer 2021's most sought-after fashion staples, from some of the most stylish cities in the world.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Jenni Kayne Everyday Sweater ($145) We're obsessed with the rolled edges on this relaxed, cozy sweater. It's perfect for layering for fall and we can't wait to never take it off. UGG Fluff Yeah Genuine Shearling Slipper ($88; $48) These fluffy slippers are incredibly cozy thanks to the shearling lining. The open toed sandal design makes them easy to slide on and off and allows for optimal breathability to avoid overheating. Clare V. Simple Tote ($555; $333) This luxurious suede tote has a long strap if you aren't a fan of handles, plus it has metal feet to protect the bottom. The bag is spacious enough for all your things if you're headed to the office or just tend to overpack your purse. Levi's Wedgie High Waist Crop Straight Leg Jeans ($98; $60) Wear these cropped jeans with booties and a cropped sweater for a comfy everyday look. This style lifts your butt and hugs your hips to show off your curves. Caslon Military Loafer ($90; $54) If you've been dabbling in the school girl-chic style that's trending right now, add these loafers to your wardrobe queue. The foot bed is nicely cushioned for extra support and comfort. Halogen Crewneck Sweater ($49; $29) Pair this cropped sweater with some high waisted jeans or a skirt for a casual and trendy look. It comes in three colors (but we love the pink). True & Co. True Body Lift Triangle Bra ($58; $35) The comfiness of a seamless, buttery soft bra is unmatched. This one is longer lined and has adjustable straps, too. Zella Coastal Pocket Joggers ($49; $29) These super soft and stretchy joggers aren't just great for the gym but also for a reality TV binge session on the couch since they're the ultimate lounge pant. Sam Edelmen Olly Knee High Boot ($225; $135) Looking for a go-to heeled boot? Stop your search because these contemporary pair are comfortable and insanely cute for any outfit. Thread & Supply Shirt Jacket ($49; $29) Everyone needs a shacket this fall and we like them a little bigger to layer sweaters underneath. This one is flannel for some added warmth on those chillier days. Alo Soho Pullover ($114; $69) Stay relaxed in a super soft crewneck sweatshirt that doubles as a blanket because it's so warm. Sam Edelman Lex Boot ($180; $108) Combat boots are a favorite this season and we love the neutral, tan shade of this pair. Throw them on under a pair of straight leg jeans or with a cute skirt for a bit of edge to your look.

,“I want to emphasise the beauty of the country”: Maria Grazia Chiuri on hosting Dior’s Cruise 2022 collection in Athens,,https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/i-want-to-emphasise-the-beauty-of-the-country-maria-grazia-chiuri-on-hosting-diors-cruise-2022-collection-in-athens,Elis Kiss,https://assets.vogue.in/photos/60cc47404fba32b9b63fd5c3/1:1/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Credit_Dionisis%2520Andrianopoulos.jpg,,18 June 2021,,"Follow us By Elis Kiss Maria Grazia Chiuri has embarked on a Greek odyssey, of sorts. It’s a fashion journey, of course, but also a personal one. It’s a deeply personal adventure for the Dior creative director, who takes us from Crete to Delphi (via Santorini) before arriving in Athens on the evening of 17 June, when the house will unveil its Cruise collection at the capital's historic Panathenaic Stadium. This is neither Chiuri’s, nor Dior’s, first escape to the mythologised islands. “It was my decision to work in this way because I need to find a reason to make a collection around the world that, in my point of view, has a sense. We have fashion week, so if we only want to show a collection, it’s not necessary to go around the world,” she says. “Also, for us, it has to do with the early DNA of Dior because Mr Dior immediately started travelling abroad with his collections. His reasons were completely different from my reasons. We are talking about 1947, a time where there was no internet, none of the digital landscape that connects you to the rest of the world. For him, it had to do with understanding women around the world, the different lifestyles, as well as the idea of creating a brand that could be in dialogue with women around the world.” Chiuri’s first trip came right after graduation when, together with a group of friends, she discovered the country’s architecture and sea, while savouring ‘souvlaki’, a traditional dish of skewered meat. She also had ‘a moment’ at the monastery complex of Meteora in central Greece, and is hoping to take her children there one day. Going back in time, the French maison’s first experience on Greek soil took place in 1951, when a team of models and staff arrived in Athens. Among the team’s engagements and activities was a walk up to the Acropolis for what turned out to be an iconic photoshoot featuring couture garments by Dior—the photos, shot by Jean-Pierre Pedrazzini, appeared in Paris Match magazine. If Dior’s full-skirt dresses exemplified postwar hope and optimism, Chiuri’s Cruise 2022 collection is set to explore some of Greece’s own talent. A few months ago, local press reported how Chiuri and members of her team visited the country on a creative scouting trip, meeting local artists and artisans and viewing their work. Some of this work is scheduled to appear on the Cruise catwalk. What’s more, Dior has received the green light for a fashion shoot at the Acropolis, 70 years after the first one took place. The Athens show follows previous Dior Cruise presentations in Marrakesh, Morocco, and the town of Lecce in Puglia, Italy. Why has this particular collection developed into such an elaborate level of storytelling? A luxury fashion powerhouse with a worldwide following, Dior is still adding to the dialogue—but how do you reinterpret the universal values taught by a country such as Greece? How do you translate elements of an ancient world that has been a recurring theme in international fashion—from designers such as Madeleine Vionnet and Madame Grès to Greece’s own Sophia Kokosalaki—for the present day? Trust Chiuri to go about it in her own way. For starters, she has done some serious homework. She began by rereading the Greek myths in November—works she had first studied at school. The show’s location comes with certain challenges. “Greece was a difficult choice,” she notes. “I’m Italian, my father came from Magna Graecia in southern Italy. I live in Rome, I studied James Joyce’s Ulysses at school, it’s really part of my culture. There is a little town in Puglia where they speak the Griko dialect. It’s such a mix of my culture and the entire western culture that I had to restart again, to study everything from a different point of view.” For Chiuri, this different perspective is a feminist perspective. After all, the notion of female empowerment has been a focal point of her vision at Dior, starting with her debut SS17 collection, which included the “We should all be feminists” mantra of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, printed on a T-shirt. Excerpts from a face-to-face discussion with Italian art historian Filippo Cosmelli—in which the two discuss the Mother Goddess archetype—are included and Chiuri also uses images of powerful female figures such as the Snake Goddess of Minoan Crete. The conversation regarding women’s trajectory and place in the world—from past to present—will continue at the all-marble, 4th-century Kallimarmaro. “I would like to speak about Greece now,” she says. “I want to emphasise the beauty of the country, its craftsmanship, but at the same time speak about now. I have no ambition to speak about the future, but we can speak about what it is possible to do now, in this moment, because fashion speaks about what is happening now.” This article originally appeared on Vogue.gr See more stories Condé Nast India © 2022 Condé Nast",“I want to emphasise the beauty of the country”: Maria Grazia Chiuri on hosting Dior’s Cruise 2022 collection in Athens, Edition India LargeChevron Open Navigation Menu Fashion Beauty Vogue Closet Wedding Wardrobe Horoscope What's New Wedding Show Magazine Culture & Lifestyle  Close Navigation Menu Fashion  By Elis Kiss By Elis Kiss By  Dionisis Andrianopoulos Greece DIOR Update Me      Do Not Sell My Personal Info  Select international site India LargeChevron
Shopping,Short wedding dresses are trending so here are 21 of the best picks for your summer wedding,Perfect for the modern bride.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/short-wedding-dresses,Georgia Trodd ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61388ed530654311017f647e/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/short.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Georgia Trodd The sun is finally shining and the allotted 30-guest rule for weddings is about to be lifted (June 21st, we’re so glad you’re nearly here), so what better way to celebrate your summer wedding than with a short wedding dress? According to LYST, searches for bridal mini dresses are up 170% and that’s more than enough for us to take note. Not only is it the perfect length for warmer climes (say goodbye to layers of tulle and overheating), but a short wedding dress is the ultimate statement to make if you’re a modern bride. No one ever expects it, it certainly makes a non-traditional statement, and you’re able to wear it again should you wish to. We’ve already rounded up the best boho wedding dresses, maternity wedding dresses and high street wedding dresses for all year round, but short wedding dresses are a whole different ball game. Trust us when we say there are some stunning designs that will have you feeling confident and looking sophisticated all while being above the knee. We don’t blame you for assuming that there’s only one type of dress to choose from when it comes to your big day (typically floor-length and made of chiffon, satin or lace), but actually there are loads of alternatives that will show off your individuality while suiting your theme and decorations perfectly. There’s no reason as to why you can’t join your gal pals with their short bridesmaids dresses and have a shorter hemline yourself. You’ll want to look your best for all the wedding snaps - especially after a year of wearing loungewear - after all, the pictures will sit on your coffee table for the rest of your life. However, you’ll still want everyone to know you’re the bride and not out for a day at the races. So comes the difficult task of striking the perfect balance of elegant/not-too-glam/practical for the heat. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. To give you a helping hand and tick another thing off your pre-nuptial to-do list, we've curated a list of our favourite short wedding dress styles to cater to a variety of tastes, from shops including ASOS, Net-A-Porter, John Lewis and Selfridges. For something short and sweet, look to this ASOS Edition Gigi Lace Mini Dress (PSA: ASOS has just launched a Wedding Shop for all of your bridal needs), or if you wanted a figure-hugging alternative then this Lauren Ralph Lauren Darian dress is ideal. But if you’re keen to embrace more drama and volume then look to this beauty by Carolina Herrera. You’ll look stunning no matter what you pick.

With Karl Lagerfeld, Yves Saint Laurent, Giorgio Armani, and Gabriela Hearst among its previous recipients, the prestigious award has a history of recognising, celebrating, and honing remarkable creative talent from across the globe. Each year, the design competition tasks the participants with a simple mission: to create a collection infused with Merino wool while highlighting its beauty, versatility, and adaptability. A commitment towards sustainable practices has been recurring in recent years, given it is the need of the hour. For 2022, the theme for the program is ‘Play’, a celebration of forward-thinking design and innovation. The finalists will be designing a Merino wool capsule collection comprising a total of six looks, while experimenting with textiles, design and business practices to drive change and innovation for a brighter future. Shortlisted by an panel of expert industry members and The Woolmark Company from hundreds of applicants, the seven finalists for the 2022 Woolmark Prize are: Ahluwalia (United Kingdom), EGONlab (France), Jordan Dalah (Australia), Mmusomaxwell (South Africa), Peter Do (USA), Rui (China), and Saul Nash (United Kingdom). Alhuwalia Egonlab Jordan Dalah Mmusomaxwell Peter Do Rui Sual Nash Each finalist will be granted AU$60,000 to conceptualise and create their six-look capsule collection using Australian merino wool, which will be presented at the final showdown next year. The finalists will also be supported by figures such as Holli Rogers, Chief Brand Officer, Farfetch; Sinéad Burke, Educator and Advocate; Sara Sozzani Maino, Head of Vogue Talents, Deputy Director Vogue Italia and Tim Blanks, Editor-at-Large, Business of Fashion, who belong to the program’s education and mentoring initiative. One finalist will win the prize and receive AU$200,000 to invest in their label, along with industry mentorship and the opportunity to stock their collections in IWP retail partners such as Matches Fashion, SSENSE, Net-A-Porter. The Karl Lagerfeld Award for Innovation will be awarded to another finalist, with the winner receiving AU$100,000. In 2014, Rahul Mishra became the first Indian designer to win the coveted prize, followed by Suket Dhir in 2015 for menswear. Ruchika Sachdeva of Bodice took home the grand prize in 2018, after showcasing a wool-focused womenswear collection - 80 per cent of which was created across five regions in India using traditional techniques, courtesy of the local artisans she worked with. Among this year’s finalists is Priya Ahluwalia, the London-based menswear designer of Nigerian and Indian descent who heads her namesake label.

Fashion,"These 14 trends will be *everywhere* next season, according to the hottest fashion week catwalks",Done with winter already? Here's what next spring will look like.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/spring-summer-2022-fashion-trends,Charlie Teather ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6155d6b7f59e45f835394d87/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/SS22TRENDS_300921_Hero_Default-2_SQ.jpg,,,," By Charlie Teather Is anyone else ready to pack away the coats and reunite with our favourite spring fashion pieces? If you're anything like us, you may well have breathed a deep sigh of relief a couple of days ago as you realised that winter – all 1,000 weeks of it – will finally be over this month. In just 4 days, in fact (not that we're counting). But with several major storms taking over the UK weather scene recently and dominating London Fashion Week, we've been served a stark reminder that, for now at least, winter hasn't left the building just yet. If anyone has the button to skip forward to warm spring sunshine, please do press it… After spending two summers – the most recent of which blessed us UK residents with a whole four days of sunshine – in varying states of national lockdown, it's no exaggeration to say that we're all owed one hell of a good one this year. We may be only very tentatively looking forward in case new variants emerge and restrictions are reintroduced, but whether you're soaking up the sun during your first holiday in what feels like forever or you're socially distancing in your garden for the third year on the trot, if the SS22 fashion weeks are anything to go by next season looks set to be a scorcher. Sure, sartorially speaking, winter isn't so bad. With permission to socialise again, our post-lockdown wardrobes have been met with a whole host of autumn/winter which are proving a lot more tempting than our recent go-to tracksuit-clad uniform and make those occasional forays back into society all the more fun. In need a little office-wear inspo to tempt you out of that loungewear? By Charlie Teather From mega knits that double up as wraparound duvets on the most freezing days to Meghan Markle's favourite ‘solo saturation’, if there's anything to make the cold season more appealing it's undoubtedly the wardrobe updates that it encourages. But let's be honest, there's little that beats a truly carefree summer wardrobe – and SS22's looks a whole lot more light-hearted, nostalgic and celebratory than we've seen for quite some time. Elleme, Spring/Summer 2022 We're talking ULTRA mini minis, super sheer fabrics, outerwear as underwear, ‘90s neons, ’00s low-slung waists and, yes, more cut-outs… Ready to skip the rest of winter and plan your spring fashion moments? For more from Glamour UK's Fashion Editor Charlie Teather, follow her on Instagram @charlieteather. High-rise jeans may have dominated our wardrobes for over a decade, but come spring 2022 things get a whole lot more '00s as the low-slung waist makes its way back to the forefront of sartorial conscious. They're all about bearing the midriff, so there's no trend value in opting for a low-rise and hiding it beneath a long knit. Opt for cropped tops for full '00s drama. Spotted at: (L-R) Staud, Versace & Knwls – as well as Cynthia Rowley, Victor Glemaud, Remain, Soulland, Rotate & Tom Ford One of the most wearable trends to come out of this round of runways was the pleated skirt, and while there was a light scattering of mini incarnations reminiscent of this summer's favourite tennis skirt, for SS22 it's all about the pleated midi. Other than that, there really are no rules. Printed, plain, colourful, monochrome, paired with knits or paired with a bralette – as long as it's pleated then you're bang on the money. Spotted at: (L-R) Rejina Pyo, COS & Erdem – as well as Sandy Liang Next season sees a new way to do metallic spangle without the need for sequins – which are often very damaging to the environment. Instead, may we encourage you to get your shine via liquid metal sheens; a far subtler, more grown-up and contemporary take on shimmer. Predominantly – but not exclusively – found in golds and silvers, these sheeny dreams create a molten metal feel as luxurious, shimmering fabric appears to be falling around your body. Spotted at: (L-R) Paul & Joe, Fendi & Peter Do – as well as Tom Ford, Khaite, Bora Aksu & Versace Perhaps a trend best-suited to those looking to have fun with fashion again after spending the best part of two years wearing tracksuits, super sheer fabrics will be having a real moment in the sun come spring. Of course, they can be cleverly layered to protect modesty, rendering this trend one of the most flexible for SS22. Spotted at: (L-R) Elleme, Rejina Pyo & Yuhan Wang – as well as Staud, Harris Reed, 16Arlington, Simone Rocha & David Koma Pleated skirts may be midi for next season, but all others are raising the hemlines to minuscule lengths. These are minis that the supermodels of the '90s would've been proud to wear, with well over half of the thigh exposed beneath the brief slip of fabric. Opt for super-statement shades, prints or fabrics to ensure that while the skirt may be small it still packs a real punch. Spotted at: (L-R) Prada, Dior & Versace – as well as Moschino & Max Mara Suits may have been off the sartorial radar for quite some months as swathes of the country took to working from home in loungewear, next season sees the old staple return with a vengeance. Stark white and complete with show-stopping accents – from waist ties to contrast black hardware and bold shoulders, these are pieces that will make the prospect of returning to your commute a whole lot more bearable. Spotted at: (L-R) Teatum Jones, Peter Do, Proenza Schouler – as well as Baum Und Pferdgarten, Holzweiler, Erdem & Michael Kors While tights are a mainstay in many winter wardrobes, when it comes to summer very few of us give even a moments thought to dressing our legs. Providing they're covered in SPF and not overheating, we're happy. But all that change next season, as thigh high boots with feathered trims, lace leggings and embroidered hosiery take centre stag. Spotted at: (L-R) Nensi Dojaka, Yuhan Wang & David Koma Strapped accents have been gaining popularity over recent seasons, but it's set to really take hold from summer 2022 onwards. Whether it's a top with multi-straps across the shoulders and décolletage, trousers with a strapped waistband criss-crossing across the stomach – or, indeed, both – you'll have to forgo any worries of awkward tan lines next season and embrace the straps. Spotted at: (L-R) Elleme, Rejina Pyo & Nensi Dojaka – as well as Altuzarra, Jonathan Simkhai, Knwls & Supriya Lele Lovers of tonal beiges, look away now. Not one for the wardrobe wallflowers among us, neon yellow looks set to be one of the hottest hues next summer. The even more intense news? It's particularly epic when worn head-to-toe. Spotted at: (L-R) David Koma, Prada & Richard Quinn – as well as Erdem, Emilia Wickstead & COS Knitwear is rarely a major summer trend for obvious reasons, but after SS21's obsession with all things crochet next season we're seeing fairweather knits be a more grown-up glow-up in the form of netting. Across tops, vests, trousers, skirts and even bags, whether you're strolling along the beach or heading for date night in the city, you'll find any excuse to put on your netted knitwear – trust us on this one. Spotted at: (L-R) KNWLS, Saint Laurent & Supriya Lele – as well as COS We know, we know, cut-outs are not new news. They were a few seasons ago, but they're proving to be far more of a long-term look than any of us initially gave them credit for. Which, surely, is a good thing – no? Cost-per-wear and environmentally-wise, the more you're happy wearing an item the better, and with cut-outs – wherever they are on an item – seemingly going nowhere fast, you'd be wise to hop on board. Spotted at: (L-R) Elleme, Jonathan Simkhai & Supriya Lele – as well as Michael Kors, Christian Siriano, Nensi Dojaka, Mark Fast, Yuhan Wang, David Koma & Maximillian at Fashion East With muted hues and style androgyny gaining traction season after season, it's been a while since super traditionally-feminine pieces had their moment on the industry's radar. For next summer, however, frothy fabrics and pretty pink hues – from pastel to candy, rose and fuchsia – prove an interesting, playful point of difference in the fashion landscape. Spotted at: (L-R) Simone Rocha, Paul & Joe & Bora Aksu – as well as Prabal Gurung Another one for the fearless dressers, summer 2022 sees underwear become a perfectly acceptable form of outerwear. Super chic when done in the right way, layer it beneath an open blazer or a top/dress with a convenient cut-out (there's that trend again) for a subtle hint of sexy. Spotted at: (L-R) Tom Ford, Fendi & David Koma – as well as Jonathan Simkhai, Coach, Ganni, Saks Potts, Michael Kors, Remain, 16Arlington, Nensi Dojaka & Elleme It's officially time to end our love affair with micro bags, as next season sees the biggest, bulkiest totes take the handbag world by storm. Great news for those of us with endless ‘essentials’ that we've been struggling to stuff in our teeny tiny bags over recent years. Less good news for our posture.

Fashion Trends,This is summer’s sexiest trend and everybody can wear it,June 21st is coming in hot.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/sexy-fashion-trend,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/613890b02b5bbea008291b6b/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bringing.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton We’ve been cocooned in tracksuits during lockdown or wrapped up in duvet coats for outside socialising... But underneath the layers there is skin desperate to feel the breeze. And with sunshine actually on the horizon in the UK (seriously, it can’t rain forever, can it?) there’s a new fashion trend in town that celebrates our new found freedom. It’s glamourous, short, tight and every body can wear it. Sexy dressing is back and tbh we’re thrilled. As Nineties fashion becomes actual vintage, the youngest crop of fashion designers have been inspired by the decade they grew up in and are creating sexy dresses worth the wardrobes of any of the original supermodels. Above: Black dresses, both Nensi Dojaka Matchesfashion.com are buying big into sexy dressing and Liane Wiggens, Head of Womenswear, believes it’s a reaction to the lifting of lockdown. “Our customers are definitely ready to celebrate the return to socialising and going out again. We are seeing a real uplift in styles that are closer to the body, fitted and more sexier dresses that celebrate the female form.” Body positive and fashionable? It’s a win-win. By Chloe Laws Above: Crystal details at Germanier Above: Maximilian. All images courtesy of Matchesfashion.com The signatures of this trend are cut-away details, intricate straps and short lengths. Although dark shades are forever in style, Liane notes that “strong colour pops” are also popular. Sculpting-mesh fabrics are used alongside curve-hugging cuts and incredible pattern cutting techniques make any body look awesome so if you’ve succumbed to ‘corona curves’ (who hasn’t?) there’s no need to steer away from dresses that show off your skin. This is the trend that champions loving your body for what it is. Liane agrees, “It is really refreshing to see designers... starting to offer a full range of sizes so that we can offer these styles to all our customers. The amazing cuts and use of fabrics in a lot of these dresses are super flattering and form fitting.” By Alexandra Fullerton Sexy dressing is a Brit-based designer-led trend that’s developed over several seasons. “We have seen the shorter, sexier silhouette coming through over the years on the London (catwalk) schedule from Christopher Kane, Ashish and Marques'Almeida,” says Liane. “These designers have set the way for new British designers to really embrace this strong, feminine trend we are seeing now.” The names to know this season are: Nensi Dojaka, Maximilian and Michael Halpern. And you can interpret sexy any which way you please. Liane says that Matchesfashion.com shoppers are “dressing it up with super glamorous fine jewellery (while) a new generation of customer is styling these dresses with flat boots in a more relaxed way.” However you decide to interpret the trend, we are here for sexy dressing.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things.  Over the past few years, moms and dads have emerged as some of our most beloved, if surprising, sources for fashion inspiration. Mom jeans, dad sandals, dad sneakers and pleated trousers have all experienced somewhat unexpected rises in popularity. But what is it about stereotypical parent fashion that we suddenly find so enviable? It was just a few years ago that we were all still laughing along with that viral SNL mom jeans sketch, but cut to 2021 and Gen Z has declared the end of the skinny jean in favor of looser, dowdier cuts. And sales of podiatrist-approved, clunky sneakers haven’t slowed down, even as the huge Balenciaga silhouettes from 2017 transition toward slightly less aggressive kicks, like the New Balance 990s. So what gives? Well, for starters mom and dad fashion is comfortable—not just physically but often mentally too. Chunky dad sneakers are much better for walking around all day without having to think about your feet, but they also might remind you of your own pop or another father figure, lending them a sense of security and familiarity not often found in most hot new trends. “These pieces are an extension of the comfort dressing trend, which was born out of our increased time spent indoors at home [during the pandemic],” says Shakaila Forbes-Bell, a fashion psychologist at Afterpay. “Nostalgic thinking has been proven to have a soothing effect. It is, therefore, no surprise that these retro styles are being embraced during this tumultuous time.” Amy Morin, LCSW and editor in chief of Verywell Mind adds, “The clothing we wear affects how we feel. Some people may opt for 'Mom jeans' or 'Dad shoes' during stressful times because thinking about being a parental figure helps them feel more secure.” It’s true that every time I put on an oversize button down shirt, I can’t help but feel like I’m cosplaying as Elizabeth James or Chessy from The Parent Trap. Those high-waisted pleated trousers make me think of Robin Williams, an idol of mine growing up. There is something lovely about honoring people who make me feel good—whether it’s folks with whom I have an IRL relationship with or those I admire from afar—with my outfit. It connects me to them, something that became increasingly important during quarantine, when isolation was a necessary difficulty we all had to endure. But outside of the comfort we sought during a pandemic—because these trends really started taking off long before the first reported case of COVID-19—there are other reasons for our newfound love of mom and dad fashion that are perhaps even more interesting than nostalgic influence. There is a more widespread change in the way people are thinking about dressing themselves overall. Millennials and Gen Z are challenging the idea of what is “flattering” and that influence will continue to thrive as this demographic enters the work force and has more and more buying power. While older generations may wonder why anyone would ever choose to wear items that actively defy traditional standards of what is flattering or sexy, younger generations are quick to mention that that’s not the point. “Flattering” has typically referred to anything that made women appear thinner, but millennials and Gen Z are more interested in abolishing those outdated standards of beauty and promoting fashion that expresses something else instead. As Morin puts it, “Sometimes people opt for trends that say something about their personalities or how they want to be perceived.” In the case of mom and dad fashion, maybe they want to be perceived as put together, on top of things, mature or some other quality they attribute to parental figures. “For many people, the last year has been a time of reflection and figuring out who they are and even who they want to be when more normal life resumes,” adds Dr. Beth Pausic, clinicial psychologist and director of behavioral health at Hims and Hers. “One positive thing coming out of the pandemic, I think, is that people have become more at ease with who they are. It seems like people will feel less restricted by what they ‘should’ be wearing versus what they want to wear.” Caroline Maguire, fashion director at Shopbop, told us, “I think ‘sexy’ is not what everyone is wanting to feel at this moment in time. Being a woman, I want to feel empowered by wearing things that I feel most comfortable in. I wear the clothes, they don’t wear me.” This emphasis on individual style and empowerment is shaping up to be the biggest fashion movement since the rise in leggings helped blur the lines between casual wear, office attire and occasion wear in the early 2000s. “The message [of mom and dad fashion] is ‘I am at ease with myself no matter what,’” says Geraldine Wharry, Afterpay’s fashion futurist, “which self manufactures a sense of comfort at great times of uncertainty.” She, and all our fashion and mental health experts, are confident that neither parent-inspired clothing, nor dressing for your mood rather than for your body type or age, will be dying down any time soon. “I think our fashion communities have embraced these trends for quite some time and they’re ready for primetime,” says Maguire. “The key is mixing up the casual aspects with something bolder. For example, I would pair a dad running sneaker with a midi voluminous dress for a casual and comfortable look,” she advises. Or you can dive headfirst into recreating the best of Danny Tanner, Clair Huxtable or Amy Matthews. As long as the clothes you’re wearing make you feel good, then you can confidently say you’re pulling off the trend.

Fashion Trends,Zebra print trousers are a major trend for Spring so here’s how to style them (and it's not as scary as you might think!),Zebra print trousers are super versatile and totally on-trend.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/zebra-print-trousers,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a7d7f5e39d30c69b3ee5/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/oliviaandalice_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton Now leopard print is a bona fide perma-trend (and just as likely to be seen on your chic granny as your two-year niece) the style set are eyeing up a new animal print. So what are they wild for, rn? Here’s a clue: it’s black and white and stripy all over and last had a fashion moment circa Y2k... You got it, zebra is the pattern that’s making our eyes go all blurry but has our wardrobes looking sharp. If you’re ready to shop the monochrome stripe, you’ll find it on everything from zebra print bikinis, blouses, dresses and jackets... But the trend that is making every outfit pop right now? Zebra print trousers. Despite their wild reputation, zebra print trousers are actually the easiest piece to style. Ever. Which means while they look so right for now, they’re a staple you should never get bored of (keeping sustainability in mind, obvs.) They look relaxed with a plain white t-shirt and box-fresh white trainers (or black ones) but they also look glamorous enough for a night out if you add heels, a tank top and some statement jewellery. The monochrome colour palette makes zebra super easy to work with. Just add more black or white if you’re wary of dressing in such a bold print. Black and white are also natural pals with pink, lime and neutral shades too. We’ve also found some colourful zebra print pieces that you could have hours of fun styling up. Just echo their tones in the rest of your outfit for a coherently styled lewk. By Alexandra Fullerton Some of our favourite pieces are from ASOS, like their Reclaimed Vintage jeans and toffee-coloured flares but we’ve also fallen for zebra print leggings as a way to zhuj up our workout gear. Marks & Spencer has a high waist version and The Upside does pair with four-way stretch. If your budget also stretches to a designer version, cult US brand Khaite has a pleat-front pair of trousers in golden metallic and Halpern’s silk pair are just the thing for Friday night drinks now they are a thing again.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Don’t @me, but there’s something about the arrival of spring that encourages me to look at my wardrobe and go, ‘ugh.’ Last year’s billowy blouses don’t feel fresh enough and the jeans (or, let’s be honest, the sweats) I’ve been wearing since winter have started to feel lackluster. Enter: The shopsies. You know, that insatiable desire to shop and shop and shop and shop. For me, that includes a renewed focus on the fact that I need new shorts, a cool pair of sunglasses and a necklace that’s a total splurge (but that I’ll cherish forever). And with life post-Covid seemingly within reach, all the more reason to stock your closet with happy acquisitions. So, I’ve pulled together a list of 18 items that I, a fashion editor, will be buying for spring. Apologies in advance to your credit card. RELATED: This 2015 Denim Style Is Making an Unexpected Comeback—and We’re Totally on Board After nearly a year of daily use, my go-to slippers could use an upgrade. And I’m pretty into the whole fuzzy sandal look as a spring/summer house shoe. Who knows, maybe these will even make an appearance outside the walls of my apartment. BUY IT ($228) A billowy, shapeless tiered dress isn’t for everyone, and Reformation finally figured out a way to make this trend look flattering for more body types. With a square neckline, an empire waist and sleeves that are voluminous but not too big, this khaki-colored number is so easy to wear. Pop on a chunky gold chain, slip on some flats or lace on some strappy sandals and you’re good to go. BUY IT ($200) On my 5’2” frame, these cropped Agoldes actually extend to my ankle and I’m not kidding when I say they’re the best fitting jeans I’ve ever owned. Not too loose but not too tight, they’re comfy to sit in, made from a light but durable (and non-stretch) material and they’re so damn flattering. This pick isn’t trendy at all, but I know I’ll get a lot of wear out of these reliable blues. BUY IT ($178) I already own this exact style in a white and brown colorway—I surprisingly get a ton of wear out of it. Buttoned up fully it’s a dress. Buttoned only halfway it’s a shirt that goes so well with leggings. Worn open it’s a duster that dresses up a basic pair of jeans. And in this black and cream scheme, it’ll get even more play in my closet. BUY IT ($165) Since last year’s loungewear is totally worn down after a year of WFH, it’s prime time to update your cozy necessities. This waffle-weave half-zip is the perfect weight to transition from spring to summer and will look almost dressy when accessorized with delicate gold jewelry for Zoom calls. BUY IT ($235) BUY IT ($115) As for shorts I plan to wear outside the house, I’ll be swapping that elastic waist for something a little more tailored. I love this mid-length cut from Aritzia that can be paired with a matching blazer and a petite crop top or worn with loose, lightweight knit. As for shoes? Chunky, comfy sandals work just as well as strappy, sexy heels. BUY IT ($98) This might be a bit too hopeful, but I’ve been mentally preparing myself for a summer packed with events (or at least dinner invitations). Which means more excuses to pull out heels and get properly dressed up. After a year of mostly shuffling around in comfy shoes only, that’ll be tough on my feet, but Inez makes heels that are designed to make your soles feel good. This strappy number has a surprising amount of arch support for a 2.8-inch stiletto. BUY IT ($238) From nail polish to shoes—and of course, bags—I just can’t get enough of mossy green this season. This little chain-adorned tote might not look like much, but it’s just the right size to carry my phone, wallet, keys and a chapstick. BUY IT ($395; $277) After approximately two decades of dedicating my life to no-show socks, I’ve jumped on the tube sock train. I pair them with leggings and sneakers for working out or running errands and have found that they add a little je ne sais quoi to any athleisure look. Perhaps that term should never be used with socks that cost around $1 a pop, but don’t knock this look till you’ve tried it. BUY IT ($11) The latest hotly anticipated collab from H&M drops today and it’s with the brilliant Simone Rocha. The Irish designer is celebrated for her saccharine sweet touches and frilly finishes, which means there’s so much to drool over. Specifically, I’ve got my eye on this asymmetrical shift dress with ruffles, plaid and a pearl embellishment. I just hope it doesn’t sell out before I can add it to my cart. BUY IT ($129) I’ll admit it: I’m terrible at replacing my bras. But after discovering the gorgeous lace concoctions from UK label Dora Larsen, I’ve decided it’s time to update my lingerie drawer. How sweet will this look purposely peeking out from under tank tops and button-downs? BUY IT ($90) Do I remember wearing a shrug knit back in high school? Absolutely. Am I shocked that they’re back in style? Honestly, yes. I personally love the modern styling of this spring-friendly sweater but there’s an easy way to recreate this look without forgoing straps; simply rock yours with a square-neck tank. It’s a small touch that will make this simple look feel very trend-forward. BUY IT ($298) The basic loafer is getting a clunky revamp this spring and you can’t beat the juxtaposition of that crisp white croc material with the walkable rubber sole. I’ll be wearing these with jeans of all shades, whether they’re slim and cropped at the ankle or loose and floor-dusting. BUY IT ($188) The second temps hit above 65 in New York, my wardrobe tends to shift over entirely to dresses. I love this Ganni number because the long sleeves mean I won’t totally freeze in this number—not to mention, it’ll look so cute layered under a black leather jacket. BUY IT ($245; $122) I have a pretty big birthday coming up this spring and I’m all about marking life’s milestones with jewelry. But this time, I’m on the hunt for something that feels a little trendy and totally unexpected—a 2021 version of a keepsake, if you will. Which is exactly how I’d describe this mixed chain Yvonne Leon necklace that features the sweetest rhodolite heart. BUY IT ($1,676) Every spring I tend to default to my denim jacket. And every spring I tell myself that this is the year I won’t rely on that workhorse. So, for spring 2021 I’ll be adding this pastel quilted shacket into the mix, as an attempt to stop relying on my trusty jean number. BTW, it also comes in cream and black, if those shades are more your speed. BUY IT ($40) If there’s one item I can always justify buying, it’s a new pair of sunglasses. They’re like SPF for my eyes, I seem to convince myself. Plus, I don’t own any pairs in this too-cool-for-school oval shape. So, yeah, I just bought these. BUY IT ($170) To make the aforementioned frames feel even more special, I’ll string them on this statement sunglasses chain. It’s chunky and a little pricey...but can also double as a mask chain. Which is the kind of multitasking I expect of my over-$100 accessories.

,"Pantone’s 2022 Colour of the Year, Very Peri, embraces strangeness",,https://www.vogue.in/fashion/content/pantones-2022-colour-of-the-year-very-peri-embraces-strangeness,Steff Yotka,https://assets.vogue.in/photos/61b45ef8310967f8c82b14f0/1:1/w_1600%2Cc_limit/00008-Valentino-Couture-Fall-21-credit-Filippo-Fior-GoRunway.jpg,,11 December 2021,,"Follow us By Steff Yotka Chet Lo spring 2022 Xüly Bet spring 2022 Iris van Herpen haute couture fall 2021 Can a colour predict the future? After the many uncertainties of 2020 and 2021, many are looking for signs from any source. The Pantone Colour of the Year 2022 is a new shade, Very Peri, one that, according to Leatrice Eiseman, the executive director of the Pantone Colour Institute, and Laurie Pressman, the vice president of the Pantone Colour Institute, embraces the uncertainty and cautious optimism of our moment. “It is a colour that really places the future ahead in a new light,” said Pressman on a Zoom call earlier this week. “We feel this was the perfect colour to get those feelings about the future across.” Saint Laurent men’s spring 2022 Balenciaga haute couture fall 2021 Louis Vuitton men’s spring 2022 The new shade of periwinkle is a result of almost a year’s worth of research and trend forecasting from the Pantone Colour Institute, which begins looking at colour trends in the late spring. “We look at so many areas, from sports to fashion, to see what people are talking about,” said Eiseman, emphasizing that increased interest in the metaverse and gaming platforms helped inspire 2022’s Colour of the Year. “There is just no question that gaming influenced the continued usage of Very Peri,” Eiseman said as screenshots from video games that use the shade flashed on the screen, “and we really want the Colour of the Year to be reflective of what is happening in the world around us.” Marques’Almeida spring 2022 Isabel Marant spring 2022 Lanvin spring 2022 Aside from being a tone used in the high-contrast games popular among Gen Z, the shade also has roots in the natural world and in wellness, with lilac, lavender, and periwinkle plants offering a calming sense during a chaotic time. Very Peri also appears in a lot of beauty and fashion trend forecasts—Pantone’s official presentation of the colour includes looks from Lanvin, Chet Lo, and Louis Vuitton men’s. Valentino haute couture fall 2021 Valentino spring 2022 Valentino haute couture fall 2021 Still, a warming purple tone might come as a surprise as the shade of 2022 after the more obvious colours Pantone chose for 2021: Ultimate Gray and a shade of yellow called Illuminating. In a release, Pantone explained that 2021’s duo was meant to signify the light at the end of the tunnel after 2020. But as many continue to battle the Omicron variant and the world enters yet another phase of uncertainty … well, can Very Peri save us? If anything, the colour offers a new perspective; as my colleague Kiana Murden wrote to me this morning, “At least it’s a new colour!” After two years of sameness and struggle, we are all feeling for something new—and the runways reflect this with tenor-shifting brands like like Threeasfour, Iris van Herpen, Xüly Bet, and Tomo Koizumi embracing the colour.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather When you think of classic, cult designer handbags, you no doubt picture the Dior saddle, the Chloe Faye, or the Fendi Peekaboo. You also likely picture your bank balance falling through the floor and quickly retire that dream for a time when you haven't just splurged several months' savings on a weekend with friends. This newfound freedom is expensive, no? Thankfully, the current must-have - as agreed by both fashion editors and influencers alike - is the very heavenly Loewe basket bag, which is right at the lower end of the luxury brand's price point. The label behind other sell-out styles such as the Puzzle, the Elephant, the Hammock and the Gate - which are all unfortunately just as pricey as they are delicious - has, for the fourth season in a row, served up the most perfect summer bag in the form of its fuss-free straw tote. In fact, several incarnations of its now-famous fuss-free tote. Starting at around £300 for the simplest versions, and climbing up to £750 for the new elephant tote, it is essentially a classic woven basket with leather handles and a leather patch embossed with the brand's iconic emblem. With several new styles having been added to the line, there are endless options as to size, colourway and even a series of softer, shoulder takes as well as woven cross-body bags. Although admittedly still more money than many would like to drop on, well, any accessory, it remains one of the best-value pieces in the much-loved Spanish design giant's repertoire, meaning loyal fans of the brand without the budget for its usual offering can snap up a slice of Loewe for a fraction of the price. And while it's undoubtedly the original style that adorns our Instagram feed most frequently, the leather label's zhushed incarnations with splashes of colour are certainly proving popular with those keen on making a bit more of a statement. Just in time for the summer that's finally shown its face, shopping app LIKEtoKNOW.it has seen an increase of 1000% in month-on-month searches for tote bags, with Loewe's basket trending at Mytheresa and undoubtedly top of the list for the sartorially savvy. Wear it with jeans an an easy tee for a lazy Saturday in a pub garden (with up to 29 friends!), with a frilly floral midi for a socially-distanced barbecue or with your cossie and Tevas at the beach (one day...). That's one big fat versatility tick from us. We all need a bit of escapism right now. By Charlie Teather Scroll down to shop our edit of Loewe's 14 best basket bags available right now...

,What EXACTLY Is Sustainable Fashion & Why Is SO Important (2022),,https://thevou.com/fashion/sustainable-fashion/,Ana Alves,https://thevou.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wtvox-what-is-sustainable-fashion-circular.jpg,,21 October 2021,https://thevou.com/author/ana/,"There’s so much confusion as to what sustainable fashion is, that having a comprehensive guide on the matter is paramount. With a carbon footprint accounting for over 10% of the global greenhouse gas emissions, there’s no secret that the fashion industry is destroying the environment. A change is much needed, from creating more awareness towards sustainable fashion practices to taking an active role in making a change. Fortunately, positive changes in the fashion landscape are happening; more ethical brands, customers demanding sustainable clothing brands, and even a dedicated ethical clothing search engine. Glorious achievements, as changes do not come easy – not in the fashion industry. Any change that deviates from the industry’s economic projections is rejected or at best, postponed. The only viable solution is a slow shift from fast to sustainable fashion, but…without impacting finances too much. In This Article: What Is Sustainable Fashion 5 Reasons Why Sustainable Fashion Is Important Top 8 Examples Of Sustainable Fashion 10 Best Sustainable Fashion Brands What Can We Do For Sustainable Fashion In this article, you’ll learn what is sustainable fashion (best definitions) and 5 reasons why is so important. We’ll detail on 8 best sustainable fashion examples, such as ethical fashion, eco-friendly fashion, vegan, slow, conscious, and so on. You’ll also learn what makes a fashion brand sustainable, what is considered greenwashing in fashion, and how to deal with it. Finally, we’ll explore the top 10 sustainable fashion brands of 2021.  According to several sustainable fashion experts, this is the most accepted definition to date: Sustainable fashion is an all-inclusive term describing products, processes, activities, and actors (policymakers, brands, consumers) aiming to achieve a carbon-neutral fashion industry, built on equality, social justice, animal welfare, and ecological integrity. According to Wikipedia, the definition of sustainable fashion (also defined as Eco-fashion and Re-fashion) is: … a movement and process fostering changeS to products and the fashion system, pushing towards greater ecological integrity and social justice. Sustainable fashion concerns more than just addressing fashion textiles or products. According to a study in the Journal of Fashion Marketing and Management, sustainable fashion is comprised of: … local sourcing and production, transparency across the supply chain, traceability of work processes and raw materials, environmentally friendly raw materials, safe working conditions, and fair wages.  One of the most asked questions is, does the world need sustainable fashion? It does, without a doubt, and here are the top 5 reasons:  Globally, there’s one garbage truck of textile waste dumped at a landfill or burnt every second. This enormous amount of waste is created by fast fashion companies that launch weekly fashion trends and fulfill them with poor quality cheap price products. In comparison, sustainable brands focus on clothing quality products from long-lasting materials. Moreover, sustainable fashion brands rarely follow fast fashion trends.  Cheap fast fashion garments are made possible by harsh working conditions for garment workers. Most fast fashion brands produce garments in developing countries where workers are paid under the living wage. Poor safety and health conditions, long working hours, and the constant pressure to produce all create an environment of worker exploitation. Frequent child labor accusations have also been brought against fast fashion brands. In comparison, sustainable clothing brands priorities fair wages and safe working conditions for all employees.  Fast fashion has a huge carbon footprint resulting from material creation, manufacturing, transportation, and even textile waste decomposing in landfills. For example, most fast fashion clothes are made from petroleum-based materials. Think acrylic, nylon, and polyester; as such, production and disposal require a significant amount of energy. On the other hand, sustainable fashion utilizes biodegradable materials from natural or recycled fabrics. These materials require little to no chemical treatment, less energy, less water, and no pesticides or fertilizers to grow.  The fashion industry is one of the largest water consumers in the world right now. The water is consumed not only for washing garments but also during manufacturing, in dyeing, and finishing processes. Just to put that into perspective, it takes about 2,720 liters of water to make one cotton shirt and a whopping 7,000 liters to make one pair of jeans! On top of consuming water, clothing production impacts the environment by polluting freshwater with toxic chemicals that find their way into waterways. In comparison, most sustainable fashion brands have “water on budget” policies that limit water usage during clothing production. Moreover, sustainable fashion prioritizes organic textiles made from linen, hemp, and organic cotton, that require little to no water during the production phase.  Animals are a vital part of our ecosystem, each playing a key role in ensuring that Earth is habitable. As such, any threat to wildlife and other animals’ safety should be a concern to us all. Leather bags, shoes, fur coats, and other goods made from animal leather, feathers, and wool, affect animal populations and, thus, the survival of humanity on this planet. In comparison, sustainable clothing brands (cruelty-free and vegan) protect animals by using leather and fur alternatives in their products, saving animals from exploitation and death while preserving the ecosystem’s balance. Sustainable fashion is an all-encapsulating term that can be hard to pin down at times. The following activities – defined by their own terms – are some of the best examples of sustainable fashion to date. Each example is an intrinsic part of the overall sustainable fashion aim. Without further ado, these are the best 8 examples of sustainable fashion right now:   Ethical and Fair-trade are two great examples of sustainable fashion. Ethical and Fair-trade activities (in the realm of fashion) are related to the welfare of people working in the industry. That is child labor, gender rights, safe working conditions, fair-trade manufacturing, and all other social justice aspects. Both Ethical Fashion and Fair-trade Fashion can be further detailed based on the activities conducted. Ethical Fashion companies, activists, and brands deal with people and their welfare, be that mental or physical. On the other hand, Fair-trade organizations and brands ensure the creation and maintenance of supply chains where farmers, manufacturers, get a fair share of the cut in exchange for their products. Together, both terms cover the socio-economic aspects of the fashion industry. As such, all actors involved in these actions are seeking ways to improve working conditions, wages, and fair trade practices.  Both terms are used in relation to environmental problems caused by the fashion industry. Think waste creation, water and soil pollution, and reckless use of resources, that are accelerating the global climate crisis. To date, over 90% of the clothing brands continue to use plastics and other non-biodegradable fibers that cause environmental damage at scale. For example, every year, over 70 million barrels of oil are used to make polyester fibers that eventually end up in oceans, killing animals or people by entering the food chain. As a solution, green-fashion companies advocate the replacement of plastics with eco-friendly, biodegradable, and natural fibers that feed the environment. To date, results are positive as the number of companies using eco-friendly and green materials such as organic cotton, hemp, mushroom leather, kelp leather, etc. are on the rise.   Vegan and Cruelty-free Fashion terms describe products manufactured without the use of materials of animal origin or obtained without cruel means. Similarly, all activities undertaken by vegan and cruelty-free fashion campaigners aim to bring to consumer attention industrial animal farming and animal exploitation for fashion. However, there are arguments that vegan fashion causes more damage than good. The argument states that most PETA-approved ‘Vegan Fashion Brands’ use PVC and plastic-based alternatives to animal leather, which saves animals from sacrifice but kills them by polluting their environment. More recently, proponents of the vegan fashion movement, insist that for a vegan clothing brand to qualify as a ‘sustainable fashion brand’ it must pay attention to its environmental impact as well. Most cruelty-free and vegan clothing brands achieve it by using leather alternatives made from plants, fruits, mushrooms, or even in the lab.  Slow Fashion is a recent term adopted to describe a way of manufacturing fashion, somehow at the opposite pole of ‘fast-fashion.’ Compared to industrial en-mass manufacturing, slow fashion is produced by expert artisans hence the use of ‘artisanal fashion’ to describe the same thing. However, it is not just the use of finite materials and wasteful manufacturing practices that depletes the planet’s resources and creates pollution. Fashion consumption and garment maintenance play equally important roles in achieving sustainable fashion – more about that below, on the ‘Conscious Fashion’ section.  Upcycled Fashion is a term used to describe the act of reusing and repurposing textiles, materials, and garments to re-create fashion. This facet of sustainable fashion upcycled is very popular amongst contemporary fashion designers and celebrities, to the point of being seeing a new form of high-end luxury fashion. As old fabrics carry their own stories of usage, wear, and life, Upcycled Fashion is more than a new way of reviving old fabrics and turning them into new clothes. The inclusion of upcycled materials in the making of new garments adds uniqueness to the final product. As such, the creation of couture via Upcycled Fashion ensures that the final piece is always unique and thus, rare. However, when it comes to how relevant is Upcycled Fashion to achieving sustainability in fashion, the opinions are split. The benefits of using upcycled materials are tremendous: On the other hand, upcycling has environmental issues that can’t be ignored:   Secondhand clothing, swapping, sharing, clothes, thrifting, and renting fashion are great examples of sustainable fashion. Available in thrift stores and second-hand shops, thrifting is a tremendous way to avoid the negative impact of fashion manufacturing. The garments already exist and therefore there is no need to manufacture them again. Moreover, there is no use of toxic chemicals, the release of greenhouse gases, or the use of a pesticide for a new collection. However, there is a less discussed downside to renting, thrifting, swapping, sharing all similar forms of second-hand and vintage fashion shopping. Ilaria Urbinati – a celebrity fashion stylist that has Rami Malek, Dwayne Johnson, Armie Hammer, Bradley Cooper, and John Krasinski, amongst her clients – explains: “WITH one hand, you’re doing good for the planet. WITH the other hand, you’re doing harm to yourself.” The problem stems from the difficulty of assessing the quality and the condition of the garment you’re going to procure this way. Little by little, garments made of animal leather or plastic will start leaching toxic chemicals on your skin. In time, these substances will affect your hormonal balance, showing on your skin, hair, nails, and so on.   Circular Fashion is another great example of sustainable fashion. The term describes ‘closed-loop’ systems, or manufacturing approaches aiming to recover discarded materials and waste, and reintegrate them into production. There are many types of circular fashion innovations. But the most common form of ‘closed-loop’ system in the fashion industry right now is the recycling of polyester and other plastic-based materials and putting them back into fashion production.  Conscious Fashion is the most popular example of sustainable fashion, seen as consumers’ way to fight the problems caused by Fast Fashion. Above all, the environmental impact of fashion depends greatly on consumers’ choices and for long they’re using their outfits. Since the emergence of fast fashion, garments are used half as much when compared to 15 years ago. This is caused in equal measure by the lower product quality and the insatiable desire to buy and showcase the latest trends. Therefore, Conscious Fashion proponents aim to educate consumers on the value of choosing slow over fast, or on how to care for their garments. For example, the act of washing and drying a pair of jeans is 2/3 of the total energy consumed during the garment’s life. In the case of underwear, the laundry process alone takes more than 80% of the total energy used. The takeaway here is that washing garments, regardless of how sustainable they are, requires electricity, water, and detergent.  All sustainable fashion examples described above are interconnected and related. All of them have a common goal of achieving a more sustainable fashion industry and a cleaner, safer world. However, while these terms and categories intersect, there is a lot of conflicts and confusion. This complexity makes it difficult to achieve sustainability in fashion. In this section, I will detail two main areas of consideration critical in achieving sustainable fashion: 1. What Makes A Fashion Brand Sustainable? 2. What is Greenwashing In Fashion? Without further ado….  Imagine this: A clothing brand is considered “ethical” for ensuring proper working conditions and fair wages for garment workers. However, if the same ethical label uses plastic and other synthetic materials, it falls into the non-eco-friendly category. Moreover, if it uses animal leather, the brand becomes unethical from an animal welfare angle. So in order for a label to be considered sustainable, it is not sufficient to perform one of the mentioned activities. It must abide by as many as possible terms to ensure environmental and social sustainability.  In very simple terms, greenwashing happens when companies claim they are doing good for the environment (or social justice) while they are not! According to Wikipedia: Greenwashing, also called “green sheen”, is a form of marketing spin in which marketing IS deceptively used to persuade the public that an organization’s products, aims and policies, are environmentally friendly. Greenwashing in fashion often happens through deceptive certifications. The purpose of certifications in fashion is to build trust between buyers and retailers. However, for a company to ‘obtain’ one of these certifications, it is often sufficient to produce a single organic cotton t-shirt. In reality, sustainable fashion certificates are granted to whoever pays for them. It is a minefield where large corporations amass certificates after certificates while small family labels that cannot afford to pay for certifications are left out and made to look unethical or unsustainable. There are a few things you can do to ensure the garment you buy is not ‘greenwashed’.  Without further ado, these are the best 10 sustainable fashion companies (and brands) you can trust and shop for in 2021.  Patagonia is recognized as one of the best sustainable clothing companies in the world right now. The outdoor brand was one of the speediest defenders of environmental ethics in the activewear fashion industry. Also, Patagonia was one of the first adopters of using recycled materials and switching to organic cotton. While using sustainable materials when it can, the brand will help you repair your clothes and gear to make them last longer. The company has Fair Trade Certified, and Bluesign approved collections with a supply chain closely monitored to ensure they are safe for the environment, workers, and consumers. Patagonia also buys and resells its creations, so you can get credit for bringing in your old Patagonia clothing or buy something pre-owned for a lower cost.  Eileen Fisher is an industry leader for all sustainable brands and ethical fashion labels. The company believes social and environmental injustices are a reason to do business entirely differently. For that, the label carefully oversees its supply chain to ensure fair working wages. By 2025, the brand’s vision is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions created during garment production. Equally, the company wants to reduce the CO2 created during shipping by 25 percent. If you’re looking for sustainable clothing of inclusive sizes, this is the brand for you – the offering ranges from XXS through 3X and includes several petite selections.   There is no sustainable clothing brand like Stella McCartney. Delightful in her stylistic duality, Stella McCartney’s creations resemble titanic collisions of natural with artificial forces. Imagine juxtaposed clashes of spirit and matter, light and dark, high and low, priceless and worthless. And, since we talk about aesthetic clothing here, imagine combinations of wasteful and saving, or haute-couture vs fast fashion. If you want a sustainable brand that’s globally recognized, then go for Stella McCartney. One thing is for sure, Stella’s eponymous and timeless compositions will not disappoint you.  Exuding a playful, bright and colorful aesthetic, Mara Hoffman’s label focuses on creating rich, textured, and understated pieces highlighting the feminine form’s power. Inspired by personal reflections on mythology and travels, the designer injects whimsy and unexpected details into her sustainable collections. Moreover, the brand’s pieces are crafted from sustainable and eco-friendly materials by close-knit expert artisans in New York City. If you are looking for tribal patterns, abstract art, and punchy prints, Mara Hoffman’s extensive collection is a must. Check out her dresses, color-blocked skirts, and high-waisted bikinis to create that style icon image every woman aspires to become.  Pact is a clothing brand obsessed with making sustainable clothes that make the world a better place. The Certified B Corp goes to great lengths to ensure the transparency of its entire supply chain. From growing and harvesting organic cotton to the final sewing and all processes in between, Pact is as clean and responsible as possible. The super-soft tees, dresses, and underwear are 100 percent cotton. Moreover, the brand’s non-GMO cotton is excellent for you and the farmers growing it.    Designed in Budapest and produced in Europe, Nanushka is a splendid clash of Eastern with Western cultures. The designer’s primary sources of inspiration are the many spiritual journeys that have morphed into Nanushka, a contemporary fashion house of informal, modern, and versatile forms. Nanushka’s effervescent confidence, easiness of style, subtle femininity, and flair are tastefully matched with an equally important ethos of eco-conscious, ethical, and animal-friendly values, for a cleaner industry and a safer tomorrow.  Reformation offers on-trend pieces that will still be stylish long after the season is over for the sustainable fashionista. This Los Angeles-based brand creates products only from sustainable and upcycled materials in a fair wage environment. This bohemian clothing brand is also a great place for those who love cottagecore, dark academia, or light academia aesthetics. Moreover, each Reformation garment comes with a description of its environmental footprint. We particularly love that Reformation has added extended sizing including petite clothing to its permanent collection.   A global leader in not just denim but in apparel at large, Levi’s is available in more than 100 countries worldwide. Donned by cowboys, presidents, and customers from all over the world, Levi’s is known for being the face of denim. The company uses nature-friendly and plant-based and eco-friendly dyes on every pair of jeans, protecting the water supply and conserving water in the production process. According to the founders, the team has always been at the forefront of change and progress: “Touting eco-friendly and sustainable practices such as recyclable denim, ethically sourced cotton, and innovations to reduce water use, in addition to giving back to its workers and community organizations alike.”  Thought clothing is an all-natural sustainable clothing company with a simple philosophy: to design and make beautiful, timeless fashion while caring for people and the environment. The brand has developed long-lasting relationships with ethical factories and suppliers to ensure that every worker is treated respectfully with fair wages and working conditions. We love the commitment to using organic cotton and natural materials, helping us clean up our wardrobe one piece at a time.  As the name suggests, Petite Studio is a sustainable clothing company specialized in petit clothing styles. Most of the brand’s products are ‘slow fashion’ taking an average of 20 hours to produce a single garment. That’s because the NYC-based brand is passionate about creating capsule wardrobe items and small-batch staples. The petite-focused clothing collection is crafted in an ethical factory located in Jiangshan, China (the founder’s hometown). Employees work 40 hours per week (with hour-long lunch breaks), receive health care and vacation time, and are even obligated to take a 30-minute nap break every shift. For more, check out our full list of sustainable clothing & affordable sustainable clothing brands  Our main role in sustainable fashion is to be aware of the impact our fashion consumption has on the environment. By now you should be familiar with the most popular examples of sustainable fashion: ethical, slow, vegan, eco-friendly, fair trade, recycled, upcycled, and so on. You also learned what are the best 10 sustainable fashion companies right now, brands you can trust and support. As you keep exploring and shopping, ensure the brands you’re buying from are minimizing their negative impact on the environment while improving the working conditions of their people. Check if the label is really sustainable; just because they sell vegan handbags or vegan leather jackets, it does not mean it is also eco-friendly. Increase the lifespan of your clothing and accessories by repairing, remaking, upcycling, and reusing your products. Buy from sustainable clothing companies that respect biodiversity, the ecosystem, and the natural resources of this planet. From brands that use carbon dioxide-free, and renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and ocean, at every stage of the manufacturing and recycling processes. Celebrities, designers, and latest news in sustainable fashion.  Do you think policymakers should step in and enforce sustainable fashion practices as they did with automobiles’ toxic emissions?

Thanks for introducing the Higg Index. This is a good step forward in standardizing the metrics for the industry Amazing article. Thank you! i am studying a fashion on my own. your article is a amazing and kind. thank you for your important knowledge. huge love!! A lot of people don’t tend to think in terms of price/carbon footprint per wear. In long run, spending money on something timeless and well-made basically costs less than buying cheaply made fast fashion stuff that needs to be replaced in a year. I think part of the problem, though, is the lack of brick-and-mortar options for ethical fashion. It’s so difficult to find physical stores where you can inspect the quality and fit before you buy. I’ve learned more about sustainable fashion from this article than 3 years of uni studies and research. Thanks for explaining in such detail what is sustainable fashion and more importantly, why sustainable fashion is so important right now, your articles are beautiful and much appreciated.

Fashion,The Pantone Colour of The Year 2022 is a seriously flattering shade of purple – here are our favourite pieces to shop now,This blue-toned purple hue should be in everyone's wardrobes.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/pantone-colour-of-the-year-2022,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/61b35e4c10b71f550900a704/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/PANETON101221_DEFAULTa3.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton How can a colour embody a moment in time? With epic research and trend forecasting skills, The Pantone Colour of The Year 2022 manages to reflect the collective mood of the planet. Pantone create of the most widely-used global colour-matching guide and have been deciphering shades that reflect our lifestyles for years… For 2022 they’ve come up with a hybrid shade of blue and purple they’ve called Very Peri. Don’t get excited, it’s got nothing to do with spicy chicken (we’re actually devd) but everything to do with trends in fashion, interiors and our online lives. We already called the shade as a fashion must wear, when we spotted *all* our favourite influencers wearing parma violet - but Pantone’s research takes a deeper dive. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. According to Leatrice Eiseman, the Pantone Color Institute executive director, and Laurie Pressman, the Pantone Color Institute vice president, Very Peri is “the perfect colour to get those feelings about the future across.” Basically we’re all feeling a mix of uncertainty and optimism that somehow just feels Very Peri. The Pantone Color Institute spend almost a year looking at trends across designer fashion on the catwalk (of course) through to sporting moments and our lifestyle changes. They’ve seen gaming become a huge influence with Gen Z, which has majorly influenced the choice of this year’s shade - it’s a colour that often appears in the metaverse. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. By Laura Hampson Pantone say, “As we emerge from an intense period of isolation… our physical and digital lives have merged in new ways. Very Peri illustrates how colour trends in the digital world are being manifested in the physical world and vice versa.” Conversely, the colour also nods to the booming wellness biz. We all need to focus on ourselves and prioritise self-care. If you’re looking for other nouns to describe the newly invented colour, it could be periwinkle, parma violet (we told you so), lilac or lavender… All plant-based influences with their roots in the natural world. It’s definitely a cooler blue toned shade. Less mauve, more lilac. From a psychological POV the mix of classic, reliable blue and energetic red combines to make a colour that's totally empowering - and that's something we are all here for as we head into the new year… For more from Glamour UK Fashion Director at large Alex Fullerton, follow her on Instagram @alexandrafullerton Double Tear Gold-Tone Crystal Earrings, £90, Roxanne Assoulin at Net-a-porter.com Save when you shop for Pantone's colour of the year with these Net-A-Porter discount codes.

By Charlie Teather If you've noticed your Insta feed suddenly getting a whole lot cooler this summer, there's a strong possibility that Bec + Bridge is the reason why. A relatively under-the-radar fashion brand, Becky Cooper and Bridget Yorston officially launched the Aussie label in 2003 after meeting at design school. Striking the balance between aspirational style and achievable fashion, the design duo have created a commercially-savvy brand that marries chic, sleek shapes with bold, recognisable designs. By Charlie Teather But despite 15 years in the industry, it's only been recently - this summer in particular - that Bec + Bridge have seen global success. Having launched in the US in 2010, it is now widely available all over with certain pieces even stocked on ASOS. Given their recent rise, it's no surprise that Bec + Bridge pieces have been snapped up and showcased by some of the world's best-dressed celebrities and influencers this summer, with the likes of Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and even Millie Mackintosh proving huge fans.

But if there's one thing we refuse to do - other than overreact about the prospect of a few hours of sunshine, of course - it's to return to our winter wardrobes. By Charlie Teather We waved goodbye to the puffer jackets and chunky jumpers a few weeks ago, and we just can't give in to them again so soon. Luckily, there's a particularly appropriate middle ground that's not only perfect for this transitional period but that is also bang-on-trend. Listen up, over-70s, because we're talking cardigans.

Of course, as is the way with the fashion industry, we're not throwing on any old cardigan haphazardly.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton When you find The One, you know. 'Til death do us part and all that. But we’re not talking weddings, this is about forever fashion. Biker jackets are one of the essential elements in any well built capsule closet. They have the ability to add edge to absolutely any outfit. Sling one over a ball gown or a trouser suit or, of course, your favourite jeans and a white t-shirt or any of your summer dresses. They’re an obvious winner for trans-seasonal styling in autumn and spring when you need to layer up but to be fair, you’ll get a lot of wear out of a biker jacket in British summertime too. Since time immemorial - well, ever since Schott created the first biker jacket, The Perfecto, in the 1920s - biker jackets have been worn by the style set’s most influential. First off it was Marlon Brando, The Ramones and Sid Vicious who made the style an emblem of the counter culture but this century it’s Kate Moss, J-Lo and Alexa Chung who have adopted the versatile outerwear. Black remains the most prevalent colour for biker jackets but chestnut, tan or red will work year round. In summer, pastel colours - like pink, sage, cream or white - look fresh. If you have four figures to invest, Saint Laurent have a biker jacket that you will wear and love for the rest of your life. If you look after it properly, it will score highly in the sustainability stakes and you’ll ace the 30 wears challenge triple fold. On the high street there are plenty of faux leather versions at achievable price-points. Urban Outfitters have a slouchy oversized style, Marks & Spencer’s version comes in perpetually chic camel while Simply B have an inclusively sized cropped jacket in taupe - a versatile pale shade available in sizes 16-32.

Sales,"Trust me, these are the 21 very best dresses in the summer sales right now",Frugality is fashionable.,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/best-womens-fashion-sales,Emily Dawes ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138a30769a8a3323e6d833a/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/best.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Emily Dawes Hands up if you’re feeling slightly bored of your current wardrobe? Don’t worry, we’re with you. We’ve all enjoyed a prolonged period of being ‘on a break’ with the majority of what’s inside our closets, and now that social lives are a thing again it’s suddenly tough to remember what we ever wore beforehand. Of course, there’s some gems in there that we’ve rediscovered. But if you’re anything like us, on the whole, you’re really feeling that year of not buying anything other than tracksuits right about now. With the return of birthdays, staycations and weddings (albeit smaller ones for now), we’re feeling the urge to shop again, and not just for casualwear this time. Some of us are even returning to offices, calling for far more put-together outfits than we’re used to lately. So, where to start? Well, the obvious choice, of course, is summer dresses. For one, summer weather has finally arrived meaning we can actually enjoy wearing them without the risk of freezing to death. But mostly, dresses are perfect for right now because of how effortlessly they can make you look good (and not like you’ve completely forgotten how to put outfits together). Throw on a dress in the morning, add your favourite pair of sandals and you’re good to go. From meetings to errands, to drinks out with the girls, a great dress is always appropriate (and makes you feel a little fancy, which we’re not mad about). No wonder they’re so darn popular. However much we’d love to be the kind of people that splurged on a whole new dress collection every summer, realistically these days - who is? It’s kinder on the environment, and our purses, to spend wisely and pick a few versatile pieces to really love for seasons to come and elevate our current wardrobes. That’s where the summer sales come in. The timing of this year's women's fashion sales couldn’t be better - just as we start to think about refreshing our wardrobes, prices have started to drop. The big e-tailers have launched first (Net-a-Porter, Matches, Farfetch, Selfridgesand Liberty sales are all live now — go go go), with & Other Stories, Arket and Mango leading the high street contingent. As always, we’re keeping our beady, bargain-loving eyes open and will be reporting back as soon as we hear of more. But for now, we’ve taken care of the stressful part of sales for you (that’s the endless scrolling and pondering over whether something’s still cool or not), and have rounded up the 21 very, very best dresses on sale right now. Trust us when we say there are a lot to choose from, but in our opinion these are the ones worth investing in now. From the most perfect wedding-guest dresses we’ve ever seen from Shrimps and Stine Goya, to easy everyday pieces like this Ganni dress that’s still at the top of all our wishlists. Don’t miss the high street deals either; we’re currently dreaming of this sage green ASOS number, and may or may not have already popped this & Other Stories puff sleeved dress in our basket. Remember, these are in-demand sale pieces, so they won’t be around for long before being snapped up; let this be a warning to you to act fast if you fall hard. Keep scrolling to see our best sales dress picks, and also (because we’re nice like that) easy links to all of the best women’s sales that are already live below.

Fashion,These modest summer dresses will keep you cool and covered up in the heat,Because you should never compromise your sense of self for your style,https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/best-modest-summer-dresses,Alexandra Fullerton ,https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138ab415341d7d4e342bf39/4:3/w_1600%2Cc_limit/wolfieaziza_sq.jpg,,,," All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Alexandra Fullerton The sun is out, the temperatures are soaring, and summer dresses are at the forefront of our minds. But if you prefer dresses with a bit more coverage, dressing modestly in the heat can be pretty damn difficult – which is why we found the best modest summer dresses that will keep you cool when you want – or need – to keep under-wraps. Our criteria for modest dresses is that they have to reach your ankles (check the models’ height so you can gauge the length on your body); the neckline should cover your collarbone (although some of our edit has a tie or small V neck) and the fabric should be opaque or be lined so there’s no need to layer – no one needs layers in a heatwave. The sleeves should reach your wrists and there shouldn’t be any sneaky splits in the skirt to turn your apparently modest-looking dress totally inappropriate.

We found plenty of inspiration from the most stylish hijab-wearing women on Instagram, obvs, but some of our favourite dresses comes from ASOS - who have a dedicated Modest section.

The cottagecore trend gets ticked with ASOS' tiered maxi dress in mixed prints – ideal for picnicking in – while their chic polka dot dress would look fab at a smart city wedding. H&M have a beautiful pale sage dress with pleated skirt and self-tie collar while ARKET have a similarly wafty raglan-sleeve version, with a tie-neck, and sweet ditsy floral print. If you have a little more budget, then Diane Von Furstenberg has a dreamy silk dress in on-trend colour clashing emerald and pink or Saloni’s maxi dress is in sky blue silk that would look stunning with orange accessories.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather If you scrolled down your Instagram feed even once last summer, you likely noticed a smorgasbord of straw bags littering the posts of some of your favourite influencers. Oversized or mini, structured and boxy or loose and carefree, these wicker bags came in every shape and size with no incarnation proving any less than wildly popular. And while the straw bag is by no means out of fashion, there's a new girl in town. And she's a whole lot more #extra... As you scrolled through the wealth of straw bags last season, you may have noticed the odd beaded bag decorating an otherwise predictable handbag landscape. You also likely noticed that they were almost all by London-based designer Hannah Weiland's label Shrimps. Catching onto the trend and providing plentiful supply for the ever-growing demand, endless brands now have a beaded offering, giving us endless options to choose from. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. One of the most playful ways to update your wardrobe, the beaded bag is the adult equivalent of candy necklaces and painted-pasta bracelets - not that we'd judge anyone for plumping for the latter... Pearlescent, metallic, wooden, plastic - these embellished totes come in all manner of materials and a wealth of colours. Pale, pastel shades have proven popular over recent months, but punchier oranges and greens look set to take a hold of the trend once summer truly kicks into gear.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather If you're anything like us, the partial lifting of lockdown and the arrival of some (relatively) good weather has got us rethinking our wardrobe. And while we'll likely never fall out of love with loungewear - after all, we formed a pretty tight bond with our comfies over the last year - there's something to be said for a little style refresh when the new season rolls in. Whether or not you're planning on heading out for a socially-distanced drink with a small group of friends any time soon, you've no doubt contemplated treating yourself to a little sartorial pick-me-up for your re-entry into the real world - whenever you feel ready to do so. By Charlie Teather Unsurprisingly several savvy shoppers have been quick off the mark, and the fashion detective in us has spotted that Zara seems to be catering particularly well to the demand thanks to four dresses in particular. Prepare to see these all over your Instagram feed this summer, and to move very quickly if you want to snap one up for yourself... The classic smocked bodice and flared skirt silhouette of this dress is undoubtedly one of the most popular shapes right now thanks to what we're dubbing the 'Sleeper effect' (if you know, you know). Combine that with this fun-but-not-sickly-sweet pink hue, simple wide straps and mid-length hem and you've got yourself the perfect summer dress. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Evening dresses are something we've barely had to consider over recent months, which is exactly why this simple-but-hugely-effective incarnation is proving so popular. The on-trend aubergine/brown hue gives it a far cooler, fresher feel than classic black, while the metal collar and open cut-out chest give it a real edge. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. It's rare to come across a statement-making piece on the high street that you can feel confident will have a place in your wardrobe forever, but this long-sleeved linen-blend midi dress is certainly such thing. A perfectly soft grassy-green colour, it's incredibly simple in design detail until you notice the two small drawstring cut-outs to each hip which add a little drama while conveniently cinching you in at the waist. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. There's no doubt about it, the seventies aesthetic is having a huge moment in the fashion world right now and the popularity of this crochet mini dress suggests that it's going nowhere soon. A look that would once have been reserved for festivals and costume parties is now one of the coolest you can wear, and if you're into the trend then this dress should be at the top of your list.

If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. By Charlie Teather Is anyone else patiently waiting for spring to actually start? Sure, we've had a couple of sunny days here and there, but it's still pretty baltic (despite what those influencers wearing swimwear in their garden would like you to believe) and there's yet to be a stretch much longer than a couple of hours of genuinely warm sunshine that's not aggressively punctuated by an overwhelming gust of wind that's cold enough to make the idea of eating outdoors - the scenario we've all been dreaming of for over a year - entirely unappealing. Call us demanding, but we think we're thoroughly deserving of a good few months of pleasant warmth and only the gentlest of breezes without having to stuff an emergency waterproof into our bags. Dressing for this weather is nigh on impossible at the best of times, never mind when it's actually illegal to go indoors with your friends once the weather turns. But one way the fashion set are combatting the chill right now is via the humble-but-brilliant long-sleeved summer dress. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Doubling up as one of the simplest styling hacks for those of us who don't actually love showing off our upper arms for whatever reason (no judgement here), a long-sleeve is a great way to add a little drama to your look right now thanks to the trend for the most #extra silhouettes. From puffed to cuffed, flared to frilled, and everything in-between (bishop, ballooned, cinched, fluted, three-quarter etc.), they're everywhere, meaning you have a smorgasbord of options when it comes to finding your fit.

Thanks, but no thanks No, thanksI'm already a PureWow fan. No, thanks I hate pretty things. Winter boots aren’t exactly the most stylish footwear option, but once that snow starts coming down and sidewalks turn into a maze of ice and slush, you’ll be glad you reached for your trusty lug-sole Sorels rather than your sleek new leather booties. But just because the weather calls for practical footwear doesn’t mean you have to forgo style all together. Here are the five rules for making winter boots look fashionable and cool in 2022. RELATED: The #1 Winter Fashion Trend New Yorkers Have Been Rocking for Years (& How You Can, Too) Wide-leg pants and loose denim may be some of the trendiest pant options right now, but one item they don’t play nicely with is winter boots. Leggings, skinny jeans or other slim-fit pants will fit much more smoothly into the shaft of your boot and create a nice lean line that elongates your legs. Shop similar styles: Madewell blazer ($175); Halogen sweater ($79); Majorelle leggings ($128); Tory Burch bag ($898); Merrell boots ($170) If you really can’t give up on your beloved straight-leg jeans (or you’re part of the “death to skinny jeans” movement), opt for pairs that hit right at the top of your boot like Coterie member Tyla-Lauren Gilmore. Then you won’t have to deal with trying to stuff all that extra fabric into your socks, nor will you have to worry about the hem of your jeans getting snowy or dirty if they’re layered over the top. (P.S. This works best with boots that are ankle height rather than mid-calf or higher. A taller boot plus super cropped jeans will throw off your proportions too much.) Shop similar styles: Nordstrom hat ($39); Unreal Fur coat ($549); Agolde jeans ($178); Sorel boots ($190) Let’s be honest, the best winter boots are frequently the least stylish (not always, but often). So how do you make sturdy, rubber-soled, lace-up boots look cute enough for meeting up with friends? Take inspiration from Grace Atwood and repeat the colors of your boot elsewhere in your outfit. Her chic beige jacket and chocolate cashmere turtleneck perfectly complement her tough winter booties and help to elevate the look overall. Shop similar styles: L.L.Bean jacket ($109); Nordstrom Signature turtleneck ($279; $168); Hudson Jeans jeans ($195); Cuyana bag ($195); UGG boots ($150) Winter boots will always have something of an outdoorsy, sporty vibe, so why not lean into it with other cabincore styles? Rather than trying to make your boots into something they’re not (sleek, pointy-toe leather shoes that pair beautifully with shirtdresses and blazers), embrace their ruggedness with flannel, shackets, denim and wide-brim felt ranchers. Shop similar styles: Wilfred Free shacket ($268); Sheertex tights ($99; $59); The North Face boots ($139) Super puffy moonboots and chunky UGGs are not the way to go if you’re prioritizing style. No matter what, they end up looking comical or like a costume (which is fine if that’s what you’re going for), but lace-up styles and slimmer fits will always look much more chic and are every bit as warm and cozy.
